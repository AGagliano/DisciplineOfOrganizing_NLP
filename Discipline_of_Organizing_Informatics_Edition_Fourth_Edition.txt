Foreword to the First Edition

This wonderful book arrives at the right time. It is more than a textbook—it de­
fines and creates the field for which it is a text. Befitting a book that lays out a
discipline of organization that spans print and digital media, this volume is care­
fully organized, with a focus on future print and digital editions.
The Discipline of Organizing has a broad scope. Even more valuable is its depth,
the result of years of examining and thinking through related concepts—often
overlapping but not identical—from the fields of library science, information sci­
ence, business, and computer science. The rare combination of breadth and
depth empowers readers by providing a new perspective and framework for or­
ganizing subsequent experiences. The organization is comprehensive and sys­
tematic, but it is not simple. A lot of concepts must be assimilated. Yet thanks to
the authors’ thoroughness, you can proceed confident that investing the time to
master novel concepts will pay off, that a coherent structure is being assembled,
without inconsistencies or confusions. Into this framework you can fit your own
examples, alongside the many provided by the authors. You can identify exten­
sions and form new associations, building on a strong foundation.
The authors ask us to step back and adopt a general, multidisciplinary perspec­
tive. This is unusual for a textbook. For good reason, the world is marked by in­
creasing specialization, the division of labor on which complex civilization de­
pends. First we master a discipline; then we are encouraged to be multidiscipli­
nary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary—to balance our specialized pur­
suits. But scholars thrive within single disciplines, and even in fields created as
multidisciplinary efforts, such as the neurosciences or cognitive science, most
researchers soon become highly specialized. So why should a student of infor­
mation undertake to master this broad perspective?

The Discipline of Organizing

By growing from insignificance to centrality in the century-old field of informa­
tion management in a few decades, digital technology has forced a disciplinary
merger. Library science, information science, computer science or informatics,
and information systems have developed different terminologies and sets of ab­
stractions. Rather than asking each camp to learn the others’ languages, the au­
thors ask each of us to engage with a new terminology and set of abstractions.
The analogy of the artificial language Esperanto may come to mind, but we are
in a better position. Esperanto is only useful if you are in a community of Esper­
antists. The abstractions in this book will be useful if others share them, but any
reader will benefit by understanding the correspondences across the ap­
proaches to information organization that we encounter today. Unlike Esperan­
to, which is just another language, the concepts in this book reveal linkages and
dependencies that we would not otherwise appreciate. The book provides a
deep foundation for understanding changes that affect our lives and will do so
more in the years ahead, a foundation that you will carry even if much of the
time you converse in the language of one or another professional tribe.
Why do I say the timing is perfect, that this effort is worthwhile today? Have
people not gotten by without it until now? The answer has two parts. One,
which is important even if you have heard it before, is that this is a time of ex­
traordinary change in our uses of information. The other is that people have not
always “gotten by” very well; years have been wasted and careers damaged by
not understanding the principles in this book. The likelihood of such wreckage
is growing, as the waves of change are larger and come at us faster. On the pos­
itive side, the waves offer tremendous opportunity for accomplishment. The
coming era of monster waves may be risky if we surf with a narrow focus, but
thrilling for those whose view extends up and down the shoreline. I believe that
if you read this book, you will see this point and be glad you read it. Let me
know.
We are used to hearing about Moore’s law and related legislation, but familiari­
ty lowers our guard. Human beings do not reason well about exponential
growth: our experience is linear, not exponential. What we overlook is that expo­
nential growth can proceed for a long time under the radar—one grain of rice,
two grains, four grains, etc., not adding up to much, but when it reaches the
point of having an impact, the impact comes so fast that we are unprepared for
it. Decades passed before accessible digital technology could support highquality photography, but when the time came, film photography disappeared so
quickly that most major companies went bankrupt. Digital audio and video were
a long time coming, then panicked and shuttered major industries. The expand­
ing capacity and diminishing cost of information storage alter the balances de­
scribed in this book. Bandwidth, increasing more slowly, is also reaching disrup­
tive levels. This book provides the best tools available for understanding the dis­
ruptions of today and tomorrow in information management.

Foreword to the First Edition

Informatics Edition

This perspective is invaluable now. It would have been useful earlier, but it was
not considered imperative for the disciplines of library science, information sci­
ence, informatics, and information systems. Historically they prospered despite
interacting less than one might have expected. Library and information science,
rooted in the humanities, focused technology efforts primarily on administrators
and specialized users. Delivering services to the public was secondary. In con­
trast, academic computer science and human-computer interaction focused on
widespread applications.
This book consciously connects fields that have focused on aspects of informa­
tion organization and management such as archiving, records management, and
curation, to information retrieval and related aspects of informatics. It explores
how related issues play out in different contexts. The authors are admirably pos­
itive. They do not drag us through the myriad disasters that resulted when li­
brary and information science did not understand the potential contributions of
digital technology and the equally unfortunate disasters that resulted when
technologists ignored a century of work on information organization.
However, I will sound a cautionary note about what might go wrong if you do
not understand the principles laid out in this book. First, for computer scientists
and engineers: Major system-building efforts foundered due to a lack of insight
into the principles of information organization. I will describe an early one,
whose protagonists, good or bad, right or wrong, are all equal now.
Although not a computer scientist or computer engineer, Vannevar Bush had as
much influence on the field as anyone through his work on shaping government
support for research after the Second World War and his 1945 Atlantic essay
“As We May Think.” Discussed in Chapter 3 [and Chapter 6], this essay de­
scribes a hypothetical machine called the Memex that would enable information
retrieval through a complex “associative memory” that supports links much like
those found in the World Wide Web today. Although Bush’s design was based on
microfilm and optical scanning rather than silicon, his vision has inspired count­
less researchers to this day.
Less well known are Bush’s classified efforts from the 1930s through early
1950s to build machines for the military and information agencies with Memex
capabilities. Meticulously detailed by historian Colin Burke in the book Informa­
tion and Secrecy: Vannevar Bush, Ultra, and the other Memex, these projects
consumed massive funding, occupied many brilliant MIT scientists for years,
and produced nothing useful. A working machine was finally produced, but
Bush never consulted with library science scholars who understood information
organization from decades of work and made naïve assumptions about how in­
formation could be organized for retrieval—the extraordinarily expensive ma­
chine was not usable in the real world.

The Discipline of Organizing

Computer scientists interested in information should adopt a broad perspective,
and this book is a place to begin. Several fields of computer science garner at­
tention today, such as machine learning, data mining, information visualization,
and design. Those centered on information, which is most directly affected by
Moore’s law, are likely to have the greatest impact.
The library and information science side of the bridge was also severely disrup­
ted. Pride in a century of disciplinary accomplishment led to complacency and
inertia. When silicon could no longer be avoided, there was not enough time to
react gracefully. Major library schools closed. Today there are schools of infor­
mation and a range of “library and information science” schools, some more
forward-looking than others. Curriculum change has been relatively ad hoc, sha­
ped by local personnel and context. Consider Information to be a large new vol­
canic cone pushing up in the midst of other peaks. No consistent approach has
emerged to navigate the range. This book provides bridges where before there
were slippery trails.
What can you do by virtue of reading and studying this book? Most importantly,
perhaps, you can avoid confusion—when reading something or talking with
someone from a different discipline, when asked a question in a job interview or
by a colleague with a different background. Knowing that differences in termi­
nology and abstractions are possible, you can ask questions and home quickly in
on understanding. I have written elsewhere that through my career, such confu­
sions frequently arose when I interacted with people in diverse disciplines, such
as management information systems, software engineering, human factors, and
so on. Because there was no book like this to clarify, it took me years to compre­
hend the source of many communication problems.
Beyond that, this book provides a foundation and framework for organizing and
thinking about your experiences. This is a textbook, pointing to areas for re­
search, providing ways of looking at new developments, and revealing to the
perceptive reader yet unexplored territory in the spaces between disciplines.
This is a book to read and put on the bookshelf—or in a folder in your digital
reader—to reread in a few years’ time.

Preface to the Fourth Edition

• Preface to the First Edition
• Preface to the Second Edition
• Preface to the Third Edition
A year ago I wrote “for a book to be republished in a third edition barely two
years after its first is highly unusual, but we were compelled to update the book
by the extremely positive reception it has received.” I also wrote that each new
course that adopts the book “ratifies the idea that multiple perspectives can re­
inforce a shared focus on organizing, while at the same time highlighting the
concepts, technologies, and methods that distinguish those points of view.”
It is happening again. In the last year the idea of data science as a new career
field has led many universities to add new courses, modify existing ones, to hire
new faculty, and even to change the names of schools or departments. Many
people teaching with or studying The Discipline of Organizing have suggested
that the book incorporate more discussion of data science concepts, and we’ve
done that in this 4th edition.
The new methods and tools of data science and machine learning let us organ­
ize more information, to do it faster, and to make predictions based on what
people have clicked on, bought, or said. Data science introduces new considera­
tions of scale and speed when massive computational power and new statistical
techniques are harnessed to organize and act on information.
But this is not the first time that new ideas and technologies have challenged
how people organized and interacted with resources, and it won’t be the last.
Data science will not replace human organizers, any more than any other sci­
ence has replaced humans.

The Discipline of Organizing

A data scientist needs to learn statistics, machine learning, and other new meth­
ods and technologies, and this book briefly sketches them, but does not try to
teach them in any detail. However, data scientists need to understand the fun­
damental concepts of information organization, resource description, category
design, and classification that are at the heart of this book. Data scientists need
to select resources wisely and decide how best to describe them, they need to
understand that resource description and categorization can be biased, they
need to understand tradeoffs and complements between people and computers,
and they need to understand when interpretability of features and organizing
principles are more important than a bit more classification accuracy in a ma­
chine learning model.
The 4th edition builds a bridge between organizing and data science. It reframes
descriptive statistics as organizing techniques, expands the treatment of classi­
fication to include computational methods, and incorporates many new exam­
ples of data-driven resource selection, organization, maintenance, and personal­
ization. It introduces a new “data science” category of discipline-specific con­
tent, both in the chapter text and in endnotes, marked with [DS] in editions that
contain endnotes.

• New sidebar: The Distinction between Data and Information (page 29)

Preface to the Fourth Edition

Informatics Edition

Just as with the 2nd and 3rd editions, we are publishing the 4th edition in a “Pro­
fessional Edition” that contains all of the discipline-tagged supplemental con­
tent and endnotes, and in a simplified “Core Concepts Edition” that omits all
supplemental content. In addition, the 4th edition is being published in an “Infor­
matics Edition” that includes all the new content related to data science, but
omits the discipline-specific content about library science, museums, and docu­
ment archives.
Many instructors, students, and readers identified content in previous editions
that was inaccurate, confusing, redundant, or missing, and I thank them as a
group. We have worked hard to resolve every concern, but as prefaces often say,
any remaining flaws are our responsibility.
However, there are some whose contributions to this 4th edition have been so
substantial that it would be thoughtless not to thank them by name. Most of
them were participants in a “book club” seminar at Berkeley during the 2015-16
academic year that thoroughly deconstructed a number of books to help us de­
sign, build, and cross the bridge between organizing and data science. These
books included The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver, Predictive Analytics by
Eric Siegel, and The Master Algorithm by Pedro Domingos. The book club par­
ticipants were Pascual Arrechea, Stacey Baradit, Dina Bseiso, Phil Braddock,
Bill Chambers, Jason Danker, Laura Desmond-Black, Paul Glenn, Daniel Griffin,
Rob Kuvinka, Molly Mahar, Emily Paul, Robyn Perry, Keshav Potluri, Shom Sar­
kar, Jordan Shedlock, Vijay Velagapudi, and Emily Witt. We learned a lot togeth­
er, and the important things we learned are now in this 4th edition.
Other Berkeley students and alums who reviewed the 4th edition include Andy
Brooks, Lisa Jervis, Ian MacFarland, Jason Ost, and Richa Prajipati.
Instructors who teach with The Discipline of Organizing can easily see places to
improve it, but David Bamman, John King, Vivien Petras, Isabelle Sperano, Mi­
kael Gunnarsson, Yasar Tonta, and Nina Wacholder reviewed the book carefully
and proposed new content.
Without Robyn Perry’s contributions as an author, reviewer, and graphic artist,
we would not have finished this edition in time for the 2016-2017 academic
year. The 4th edition was produced by Murray Maloney, as markup and produc­
tion editor.

Abstract

We organize things, we organize information, we organize information
about things, and we organize information about information. But even
though “organizing” is a fundamental and ubiquitous challenge, when we
compare these activities their contrasts are more apparent than their
commonalities. We propose to unify many perspectives about organizing
with the concept of an Organizing System, defined as an intentionally ar­
ranged collection of resources and the interactions they support. Every
Organizing System involves a collection of resources, a choice of proper­
ties or principles used to describe and arrange resources, and ways of
supporting interactions with resources. By comparing and contrasting
how these activities take place in different contexts and domains, we can
identify patterns of organizing. We can create a discipline of organizing
in a disciplined way.

1.1 The Discipline of Organizing
To organize is to create capabilities by intentionally imposing order and struc­
ture.
Organizing is such a common activity that we often do it without thinking much
about it. We organize shoes in our closet, books on our book shelves, spices in
our kitchen, receipts and records in tax preparation folders, and people on busi­
ness projects and sports teams. Quite a few of us have jobs that involve specific
types of organizing tasks. We might even have been explicitly trained to perform
them by following specialized disciplinary practices. We might learn to do these
tasks very well, but even then we often do not reflect on the similarity of the or­
ganizing tasks we do and those done by others, or on the similarity of those we
do at work and those we do at home. We take for granted and as givens the con­
cepts and methods used in the Organizing System we work with most often.

The Discipline of Organizing

The goal of this book is to help readers become more self-conscious about what
it means to organize resources of any type and about the principles by which
the resources are organized. In particular, this book introduces the concept of
an Organizing System: an intentionally arranged collection of resources and the
interactions they support. The book analyzes the design decisions that go into
any systematic organization of resources and the design patterns for the inter­
actions that make use of the resources, as follows:
We organize physical things. Each of us organizes many kinds of things in our
lives—our books on bookshelves; printed financial records in folders and filing
cabinets; clothes in dressers and closets; cooking and eating utensils in kitchen
drawers and cabinets. Public libraries organize printed books, periodicals,
maps, CDs, DVDs, and maybe some old record albums. Research libraries also
organize rare manuscripts, pamphlets, musical scores, and many other kinds of
printed information. Museums organize paintings, sculptures, and other arti­
facts of cultural, historical, or scientific value. Stores and suppliers organize
their goods for sale to consumers and to each other. Sports leagues organize
players into teams, and the teams organize players by position or role.
We organize information about physical things. Each of us organizes informa­
tion about things: when we inventory the contents of our house for insurance
purposes, when we sell our unwanted stuff on eBay, or when we rate a restau­
rant on Yelp. Library card catalogs, and their online replacements, tell us what
books a library’s collection contains and where to find them. Sensors and RFID
tags track the movement of goods—even library books—through supply chains,
and the movement (or lack of movement) of cars on highways.
We organize digital things. Each of us organizes personal digital information—
email, documents, ebooks, MP3 and video files, appointments, contacts—on our
computers, smartphone, ebook readers, or in “the cloud,” —through information
services that use Internet protocols. Large research libraries organize digital
journals and books, computer programs, government and scientific datasets, da­
tabases, and many other kinds of digital information. Companies organize their
digital business records and customer information in enterprise applications,
content repositories, and databases. Hospitals and medical clinics maintain and
exchange electronic health records and digital X-rays and scans.
We organize information about digital things. Digital library catalogs, web por­
tals, and aggregation websites organize links to other digital resources. Web
search engines use content and link analysis along with relevance ratings, to or­
ganize the billions of web pages competing for our attention. Web-based serv­
ices, data feeds and other information resources can be interconnected and
choreographed to carry out information-intensive business processes, or aggre­
gated and analyzed to enable prediction and personalization of information
services.

Let us take a closer look at these four different types or contexts of organizing.
We contrasted “organizing things” with “organizing information.” At first glance
it might seem that organizing physical things like books, compact discs, ma­
chine parts, or cooking utensils has an entirely different character than organiz­
ing intangible digital things. We often arrange physical things according to their
shapes, sizes, material of manufacture, or other intrinsic and visible properties:
for example, we might arrange our shirts in the clothes closet by style and color,
and we might organize our music collection by separating the old vinyl albums
from the CDs. We might arrange books on bookshelves by their sizes, putting all
the big, heavy picture books on the bottom shelf. Organization for clothes and
information artifacts in tangible formats that is based on visible properties does
not seem much like how you store and organize digital books on your Kindle or
arrange digital music on your music player. Arranging, storing, and accessing Xrays printed on film might appear to have little in common with these activities
when the X-rays are in digital form.
It is hardly surprising that organizing things and organizing information some­
times do not differ much when information is represented in a tangible way. The
era of ubiquitous digital information of the last decade or two is just a blip in
time compared with the more than ten thousand years of human experience
with information carved in stone, etched in clay, or printed with ink on papyrus,
parchment, or paper. These tangible information artifacts have deeply embed­
ded the notion of information as a physical thing in culture, language, and meth­
ods of information design and organization. This perspective toward tangible in­
formation artifacts is especially prominent in rare book collections where books
are revered as physical objects with a focus on their distinctive binding, callig­
raphy, and typesetting.
Nevertheless, at other times there are substantial differences in how we organ­
ize things and how we organize information, even when the latter is in physical
form. We more often organize our “information things” according to what they
are about rather than on the basis of their visible properties. At home we sort
our CDs by artist or genre; we keep cookbooks separate from travel books, and
fiction books apart from reference books. Libraries employ subject-based classi­
fication schemes that have a few hundred thousand distinct categories.
Likewise, there are times when we pay little attention to the visible properties
of tangible things when we organize them and instead arrange them according
to functional or task properties. We keep screwdrivers, pliers, a hammer, a saw,
a drill, and a level in a toolbox or together on a workbench, even though they
have few visual properties in common. We are not organizing them because of
what we see about them, but because of what we know about to use them. The
task-based organization of the tools has some similarity to the subject-based or­
ganization of the library.

27

The Discipline of Organizing

We also contrasted “organizing things” with “organizing information about
things.” This difference seems clear if we consider the traditional library card
catalog, whose printed cards describe the books on library shelves. When the
things and the information about them are both in physical format, it is easy to
see that the former is a primary resource and the latter a surrogate or associ­
ated resource that describes or relates to it.

What Is Information?
Most of the hundreds of definitions of information treat it as an idea that
swirls around equally hard-to-define terms like “data,” “knowledge,” and
“communication.” Moreover, these intellectual and ideological perspectives
on information coexist with more mundane uses of the term, as when we
ask a station agent: “Can you give me some information about the train
schedule?”
An abstract view of information as an intangible thing is the intellectual
foundation for both modern information science and the information econo­
my and society. Nevertheless, the abstract view of information often con­
flicts with the much older idea that information is a tangible thing that natu­
rally arose when information was inextricably encoded in material formats.
We often blur the sense of “information as content” with the sense of “infor­
mation as container,” and we too easily treat the number of stored bits on a
computer or in “the cloud” as a measure of information content or value.
When it comes to “organizing information about digital things” the contrast is
much less clear. When you search for a book using a search engine, first you get
the catalog description of the book, and often the book itself is just a click away.
When the things and the information about them are both digital, the contrast
we posed is not as sharp as when one or both of them is in a physical format.
And while we used X-rays—on film or in digital format—as examples of things
we might organize, when a physician studies an X-ray, is it not being used as in­
formation about the subject of the X-ray, namely, the patient? And when busi­
nesspeople make marketing and pricing decisions by analyzing digital informa­
tion about what and when people buy, we can think of this as organizing cus­
tomers into categories, or as organizing customer information.
These differences and relationships between “physical things” and “digital
things” have long been discussed and debated by philosophers, linguists, psy­
chologists, and others. (See the sidebars, What Is Information? (page 28) and
The Distinction between Data and Information (page 29).)
The distinctions among organizing physical things, organizing digital things, or
organizing information about physical or digital things are challenging to de­
scribe because many of the words we might use are as overloaded with multiple

28

Chapter 1 — Foundations for Organizing Systems

meanings as “information” itself. For example, the library science perspective
often uses presentation or implementation properties in definitions of “docu­
ment,” using the term to refer only to traditional physical forms. In contrast, the
informatics or computer science perspective takes an abstract view of “docu­
ment” to refer to any self-contained unit of information, separating a docu­
ment's content from its presentation or container.2[Com]

The Distinction between Data and Information
Astute readers might have noticed that we included sensor data as “infor­
mation about physical things” and data feeds as “information about digital
things.” Many textbooks in the information science and knowledge manage­
ment fields distinguish data and information in a more precise way. To them,
data sits at the bottom of an Information Hierarchy, Knowledge Pyramid, or
DIKW Hierarchy in which Data is transformed into Information, which is
transformed into Knowledge, which is then transformed into Wisdom.
In this framework, data are raw or elementary observations about proper­
ties of objects, events, and their environment. Data becomes information
when it is aggregated, processed, analyzed, formatted, and organized to
add meaning and context so it can be used to answer questions. This pro­
cessing can include calculation, inference, or refinement operations on the
data. For example, measurements of temperature, precipitation, and wind
speed are data. When combined and summarized, a set of data becomes
statistical information about the weather on a particular day. When collec­
ted over a period of months or years, these datasets become information
about the climate of the location where they were collected.
The Discipline of Organizing does not make this sharp contrast between da­
ta and information in the Hierarchy/Pyramid. People who read this book are
likely to be aspiring or practicing professionals in information-intensive in­
dustries where information and data are often treated as synonyms to mean
the content of a database or data-managing application. A distinction be­
tween data and information might be useful in theory, but not in these ap­
plied settings.
The distinction between data and information is also being blurred by the
expansion in the scope of the definition of data in the emerging career field
of data science. Indeed, a popular introductory text eliminates information
entirely from the Hierarchy/Pyramid with its title, Discovering knowledge in
data: an introduction to data mining.4[DS]
Similar definitional variation occurs with “author” or “creator.” When we say
that “Herman Melville is the author of Moby Dick” (Melville 1851) the meaning
of “author” does not depend on whether we have a printed copy or an ebook in

1.1 The Discipline of Organizing

29

The Discipline of Organizing

mind, but what counts as authorship varies a great deal across academic disci­
plines. Furthermore, different standards for describing resources disagree in
the precision with which they identify the person(s) or organization(s) primarily
responsible for creating the intellectual content of the resource, People who are
serious about music description rightly criticize streaming services and online
stores that have only a single “artist” field because this fails to distinguish the
composer, conductor, orchestra, and other people with distinct roles in creating
the music.
If we allow the concept of information to be anything we can study—to be “any­
thing that informs”—the concept becomes unbounded. Our goal in this book is
to bridge the intellectual gulf that separates the many disciplines that share the
goal of organizing but differ in what they organize. This requires us to focus on
situations where information exists because of intentional acts to create or or­
ganize. (See the sidebar, The Discipline of Organizing (page 31))
Many of the foundational topics for a discipline of organizing have traditionally
been presented from the perspective of the library sector and taught as “library
and information science.” These include bibliographic description, classifica­
tion, naming, authority control, curation, and information standards. In recent
decades these foundations have been built on and extended by computer sci­
ence, cognitive science, informatics, and other new fields to include more pri­
vate sector and non-bibliographic contexts, multimedia and social media, and
new information-intensive applications and service systems enabled by mobile,
pervasive, and scientific computing. The latest additions to the discipline of or­
ganizing are coming from data science and machine learning, introducing con­
siderations of speed and scale that arise when massive computational power
and new statistical techniques are harnessed to organize and act on informa­
tion.
The new methods and tools of data science and machine learning let us organ­
ize more information, to do it faster, and to make predictions based on what
people have clicked on, bought, or said. But this is not the first time that new
ideas and technologies have challenged how people organized and interacted
with resources. Fifty years ago, searchable online catalogs radically changed
how people used libraries. The web, invented less than thirty years ago so that
scientists could share technical reports, is now an essential part of many human
activities. It is important not to view the latest new thing as changing every­
thing, because new things will continue to come, and these technology break­
throughs still depend on and complement the organizing work done by people.
Data science will not replace human organizers, any more than any other sci­
ence has replaced humans. (See sidebar, Data Science and the Discipline of Or­
ganizing (page 32)).

The Discipline of Organizing
A discipline is an integrated field of study in which there is some level of
agreement about the issues and problems that deserve study, how they are
interrelated, how they should be studied, and how findings or theories
about the issues and problems should be evaluated. A framework is a set of
concepts that provide the basic structure for understanding a domain, ena­
bling a common vocabulary for different explanatory theories.
Organizing is a fundamental issue in many disciplines, most notably library
and information science, computer science, systems analysis, informatics,
law, economics, and business. However, these disciplines have only limited
agreement in how they approach problems of organizing and what they
seek as their solutions. For example, library and information science has
traditionally studied organizing from a public sector bibliographic perspec­
tive, paying careful attention to user requirements for access and preserva­
tion, and offering prescriptive methods and solutions. In contrast, computer
science and informatics tend to study organizing in the context of
information-intensive business applications with a focus on process efficien­
cy, system architecture, and implementation. The disciplines of manage­
ment and industrial organization deal with the organization of human, mate­
rial, and information resources in contexts shaped by commercial, competi­
tive, and regulatory forces.
This book presents a more abstract framework for issues and problems of
organizing that emphasizes the common concepts and goals of the disci­
plines that study them. Our framework proposes that every system of organ­
ization involves a collection of resources, and we can treat physical things,
digital things, and information about such things as resources. Every system
of organization involves a choice of properties or principles used to describe
and arrange the resources, and ways of supporting interactions with the re­
sources. By comparing and contrasting how these activities take place in
different contexts and domains, we can identify patterns of organizing and
see that Organizing Systems often follow a common life cycle. We can cre­
ate a discipline of organizing in a disciplined way.
This is why we need to take a transdisciplinary view that lets us emphasize what
the different disciplines have in common and how they fit together rather than
what distinguishes them. Resource selection, organizing, interaction design,
and maintenance are taught in every discipline, but these concepts go by differ­
ent names. A vocabulary for discussing common organizing challenges and is­
sues that might be otherwise obscured by narrow disciplinary perspectives
helps us understand existing systems of organizing better while also suggesting
how to invent new ones by making different design choices.

Data Science and the Discipline of Organizing
Advances in computing power and statistical techniques are making it possi­
ble to identify patterns in data and extract meaningful information at a scale
never before possible. Many books and articles about data science, machine
learning, and predictive analytics make bold predictions that these emerg­
ing fields will radically change the world. These claims are both provocative
and promising, but at its core, data science is about how resources are se­
lected, described, and organized; concepts with a long tradition in informa­
tion and library science. Instead of organizing and describing the books in a
library or the products in a warehouse, a data scientist might organize in­
formation about books or products into massive data tables, treating each
resource as a row and its descriptive properties as the columns. After peo­
ple might have organized books or products into categories, machine learn­
ing techniques might classify new books or products using those categories,
or perhaps discover new categories based on access or purchasing behav­
iors. So while the techniques of data science are new, many of the challeng­
es are not; data scientists need to select resources wisely and decide how
best to describe them; they need to understand that resource description
and categorization can be biased; they need to understand the tradeoffs and
complements between people and computers; and, they need to test the dis­
coveries that algorithms make with controlled experiments.
To make sense of the discussions around data science, one must understand
the difference between kind and degree. A hundred years ago, a car’s high­
way travel speed was about forty miles an hour. Today’s cars travel twice as
fast, but this is just a change in degree. However, an increase in speed to
about 17,500 miles an hour achieves an “orbital velocity” that allows us to
go into Earth orbit in space, travel that is different in kind.
What about data science? Some data science involves collections of data
that are “tall,” containing many millions or even billions of records that
each have a relatively small number of variables. Being able to analyze
“tall” data more rapidly than ever before is primarily a change in degree
compared with traditional database techniques. Nevertheless, for collec­
tions of data that are “wide,” where each record might contain hundreds or
thousands of variables, data science techniques might allow us to see pat­
terns that could not be seen at all, or could not be seen affordably and in
quantity. Here, data science might be yielding changes in kind.6[DS]

Figure 1.1. An Organizing System.

An Organizing System is a collection of resources arranged in ways that enable
people or computational agents to interact with them.

1.2 The “Organizing System” Concept
We propose to unify many perspectives about organizing and information with
the concept of an Organizing System, an intentionally arranged collection of re­
sources and the interactions they support. This definition brings together sever­
al essential ideas that we will briefly introduce in this chapter and then develop
in detail in subsequent chapters.
Figure 1.1 depicts a conceptual model of an Organizing System that shows in­
tentionally arranged resources, interactions (distinguished by different types of
arrows), and the human and computational agents interacting with the resour­
ces in different contexts.
An Organizing System is an abstract characterization of how some collection of
resources is described and arranged to enable human or computational agents
to interact with the resources. The Organizing System is an architectural and
conceptual view that is distinct from the physical arrangement of resources that
might embody it, and also distinct from the person, enterprise, or institution
that implements and operates it. These distinctions are sometimes hard to main­
tain in ordinary language; for example, we might describe some set of resource
descriptions, organizing principles, and supported interactions as a “library” Or­
ganizing System. However, we also need at times to refer to a “library” as the

1.2 The “Organizing System” Concept

33

The Discipline of Organizing

institution in which this Organizing System operates, and of course the idea of a
“library” as a physical facility is deeply engrained in language and culture.
Our concept of the Organizing System was in part inspired by the concepts pro­
posed in 2000 for bibliographic domains by Elaine Svenonius, in The Intellectual
Foundation of Information Organization. She recognized that the traditional in­
formation organization activities of bibliographic description and cataloging
were complemented, and partly compensated for, by automated text processing
and indexing that were usually treated as part of a separate discipline of infor­
mation retrieval. Svenonius proposed that decisions about organizing informa­
tion and decisions about retrieving information were inherently linked by a
tradeoff principle and thus needed to be viewed as an interconnected system:
“The effectiveness of a system for accessing information is a direct function of
the intelligence put into organizing it” (p.ix). We celebrate and build upon her
insights by beginning each of the sub-parts of Chapter 2 with a quote from her
book.
A systems view of information organization and information retrieval captures
and provides structure for the inherent tradeoffs obscured by the silos of tradi­
tional disciplinary and category perspectives: the more effort put into organiz­
ing information “on the way in” when it is created or added to a collection, the
more effectively it can be retrieved, and the more effort put into retrieving in­
formation “on the way out,” the less it needs to be organized first. Sometimes a
collection of resources is highly organized, but because it was organized by
someone else for different purposes that have in mind, we need to reorganize it
“on the way in.” This is especially common with digital text or datasets, where
previously organized resources or their descriptions might be sorted, translated
in format or language, combined, summarized, or otherwise transformed to fit
into a new Organizing System. For example, to understand seasonal buying pat­
terns, a retailer might combine shopping data with weather data and calendar
data about commonly-watched sporting events (because bad weather and
broadcast sports cause people to stay home), and all three datasets would need
to describe “time” and “location” in the same way.
A systems view no longer contrasts information organization as a human activity
and information retrieval as a machine activity, or information organization as a
topic for library and information science and information retrieval as one for
computer science. Instead, we readily see that computers now assist people in
organizing and that people contribute much of the information used when com­
puters analyze and organize resources. For example, many algorithms for com­
putational classification use supervised learning approaches that start with
items classified by people.
Finally, a systems view can be applied to Organizing Systems with any kind of
resource, enabling more nuanced discussion of how economic, social, and cogni­

34

Chapter 1 — Foundations for Organizing Systems

tive costs and benefits of organizing are allocated among different stakeholders.
Every Organizing System is biased by the perspectives and experiences of the
people who create it. Some of these biases are inescapable, a kind of automatic
organizing, because they reflect innate human perceptual and cognitive capabil­
ities. Our minds impose structure and find patterns, even when there aren’t any,
and we are not capable of acting perfectly rationally, so we simplify without re­
alizing it. People are also not very good at thinking about future possibilities
and revising their expectations given new evidence, and this mental inertia
makes us preserve resources and interactions in Organizing Systems that are
no longer needed. Other biases in Organizing Systems reflect more intentional
choices that implicitly or explicitly create winners or losers, treat some interac­
tions as preferred while deprecating others, or otherwise impose or overlay a
set of values on the stakeholders of the system. For example, many Organizing
Systems arrange people in groups or queues to make interactions more effi­
cient, but when an airline gives boarding priority to customers who paid more
for their tickets it might not seem fair to you if are in the last boarding group.

1.3 The Concept of “Resource”
Resource has an ordinary sense of anything of value that can support goaloriented activity. This definition means that a resource can be a physical thing, a
non-physical thing, information about physical things, information about nonphysical things, or anything you want to organize. Other words that aim for this
broad scope are entity, object, item, and instance. Document is often used for
an information resource in either digital or physical format; artifact refers to re­
sources created by people, and asset for resources with economic value.
Resource has specialized meaning in Internet architecture. It is conventional to
describe web pages, images, videos, and so on as resources, and the protocol
for accessing them, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), uses the Uniform Re­
source Identifier (URI).8[Web]
Treating as a primary resource anything that can be identified is an important
generalization of the concept because it enables web-based services, data feeds,
objects with RFID tags, sensors or other smart devices, or computational agents
to be part of Organizing Systems.
Instead of emphasizing the differences between tangible and intangible resour­
ces, we consider it essential to determine whether the tangible resource has in­
formation content—whether it needs to be treated as being “about” or repre­
senting some other resource rather than being treated as a thing in itself.
Whether a book is printed or digital, we focus on its information content, what it
is about; its tangible properties become secondary. In contrast, the hangars in
our closet and the measuring cups in our kitchen are not about anything more
than their obvious utilitarian features, which makes their tangible properties

Concert Tickets

Concert Ticket
A concert ticket is a vehi­
cle for conveying a pack­
age of assertions about an
event, so it is a descrip­
tion resource, like a card
in a library card catalog.
A concert ticket is also a
resource in its own right,
with intrinsic value; it can
be bought and sold, some­
times for a greater price
than its resource descrip­
tion specifies. A ticket is a
license to use a seat in a
venue for a specified pur­
pose at a specified time;
after the event, the ticket
loses its intrinsic value,
but might acquire extrin­
sic value as an artifact in
a collection like this one.

Tickets are physical artifacts that convey
event-related metadata: including time,
place, and seat number; price and terms of
admission; and featured performers. For
concert goers, tickets offer the promise of all
that, and a memory of the ineffable quality of

there is no sharp boundary

ganizing Systems are descrip­

tion resources or surrogate re­
sources that describe the pri­
mary resources; library catalog entries or the list of results in web search en­
gines are familiar examples. In museums, information about the production, dis­
covery, or history of ownership of a resource can be more important than the re­
source; a few shards of pottery are of little value without these associated infor­
mation resources. Similarly, business or scientific data often cannot be under­
stood or analyzed without additional information about the manner in which
they were collected. Most web-based businesses exploit data about how users

interact with resources, such as the log files that record every web search you
make, every link you click, and every web page you visit.
Resources that describe, or are associated with other resources are sometimes
called metadata. However, when we look more broadly at Organizing Systems, it
is often difficult to distinguish between the resource being described and any
description of it or associated with it. One challenge is that when descriptions
are embedded in resources, as metadata often is—in the title page of a book,
the masthead of a newspaper, or the source of web pages—deciding which re­
sources are primary is often arbitrary.
A second challenge is that what serves as metadata for one person or process
can function as a primary resource or data for another one. Rather than being
an inherent distinction, the difference between primary and associated resour­
ces is often just a decision about which resource we are focusing on in some sit­
uation. An animal specimen in a natural history museum might be a primary re­
source for museum visitors and scientists interested in anatomy, but information
about where the specimen was collected is the primary resource for scientists
interested in ecology or migration.
Organizing Systems can refer to people as resources, and we often use that
term to avoid specifying the gender or specific role of an employee or worker, as
in the management concept of the “human resources” department in a work­
place. A business is defined by its intentional arrangement of human resources,
and there is both variety and regularity in these arrangements (see the sidebar,
Business Structures (page 296) in §6.5). 9[Phil]
Human resources in Organizing Systems can be understood much the same way
as inanimate physical or digital resources: they are selected, organized, and
managed, and can create value individually or through their interactions with
others inside and outside of the system.10[Bus] However, human beings are
uniquely complicated resources, and any Organizing System that uses them
must take into account their rights, motivations, and relationships. (See the
sidebar, People as Resources (page 172).)

1.4 The Concept of “Collection”
A collection is a group of resources that have been selected for some purpose.
Similar terms are set (mathematics), aggregation (data modeling), dataset (sci­
ence and business), and corpus (linguistics and literary analysis).
We prefer collection because it has fewer specialized meanings. Collection is
typically used to describe personal sets of physical resources (my stamp or re­
cord album collection) as well as digital ones (my collection of digital music). We
distinguish law libraries from software libraries, knowledge management sys­
tems from data warehouses, and personal stamp collections from coin collec­
1.4 The Concept of “Collection”

tions primarily because they contain different kinds of resources. Similarly, we
distinguish document collections by resource type, contrasting narrative docu­
ment types like novels and biographies with transactional ones like catalogs and
invoices, with hybrid forms like textbooks and encyclopedias in between.
A collection can contain identifiers for resources along with or instead of the re­
sources themselves, which enables a resource to be part of more than one col­
lection, like songs in playlists.
A collection itself is also a resource. Like other resources, a collection can have
description resources associated with it. An index is a description resource that
contains information about the locations and frequencies of terms in a docu­
ment collection to enable it to be searched efficiently.
Because collections are an important and frequently used kind of resource, it is
important to distinguish them as a separate concept. In particular, the concept
of collection has deep roots in libraries, museums and other institutions that se­
lect, assemble, arrange, and maintain resources. Organizing Systems in these
domains can often be described as collections of collections that are variously
organized according to resource type, author, creator, or collector of the resour­
ces in the collection, or any number of other principles or properties. In busi­
ness contexts, the use of “collection” to describe a set of resources is much less
common, but businesses organize many types of resources, including their em­
ployees, suppliers, customers, products, and the tangible and intangible assets
used to create the products and run the business. Indeed, a business itself can
sometimes be abstractly described as a collection of resources, especially when
the resources are software components or services. (See endnote46 [Com].)
A type of resource and its conventional Organizing System are often the focal
point of a discipline. Category labels such as library, museum, zoo, and data re­
pository have core meanings and many associated experiences and practices.
Specialized concepts and vocabularies often evolve to describe these. The rich­
ness that follows from this complex social and cultural construction makes it dif­
ficult to define category boundaries precisely.
We can always create new categories by stretching the conventional definitions
of “library” or other familiar Organizing Systems and adding modifiers, as when
Flickr is described as a web-based photo-sharing library. But whenever we de­
fine an Organizing System with respect to a familiar category, the typical or
mainstream instances and characteristics of that category that are deeply em­
bedded in language and culture are reinforced, and those that are atypical are
marginalized. In the Flickr case, this means we suggest features that are not
there (like authoritative classification) or omit the features that are distinctive
(like tagging by users).

What Is a Library?
Most birds fly, but not all of them do. What characteristics are most impor­
tant to us when we classify something as a bird? What characteristics are
most important when we think of something as a library?
We might treat circulation, borrowing and returning the same item, as one
of the interactions with resources that defines a library. In that case, an in­
stitution that lends items in its collection with the hope that the borrowers
return something else that is better hardly seems like a library. But if the re­
sources are the seeds of heirloom plants and the borrowers are expected to
return seeds from the plants they grew from the borrowed seeds, perhaps
“seed library” is an apt name for this novel Organizing System. Similarly,
even though the resources in its collection are encyclopedia articles rather
than living species, the Wikipedia open-source encyclopedia resembles the
Seed Library by encouraging its users to “return” articles that are improve­
ments of the current ones.
The photo-sharing website Flickr functions for most of its users as a person­
al photo archiving site. Flickr’s billions of user-uploaded photos and the
choice of many users to share them publicly transform it into a searchable
shared collection, and many people also think of Flickr as a photo library.
But Flickr lacks the authoritative description and standard classification
that typify a library.
A similar categorization challenge arises with the Google Books digitization
project. 11[Law]
More generally, a categorical view of Organizing Systems makes it matter great­
ly which category is used to anchor definitions or comparisons. The Google
Books project makes out-of-print and scholarly works vastly more accessible,
but when Google co-founder Sergei Brin described it as “a library to last forev­
er” it upset many people with a more traditional sense of what the library cate­
gory implies. We can readily identify design choices in Google Books that are
more characteristic of the Organizing Systems in business domains, and the
project might have been perceived more favorably had it been described as an
online bookstore that offered many beneficial services for free.

1.5 The Concept of “Intentional Arrangement”
Intentional arrangement emphasizes explicit or implicit acts of organization by
people, or by computational processes acting as proxies for, or as implementa­
tions of, human intentionality. Intentional arrangement is easiest to see in Or­
ganizing Systems created by individual people who can make all the necessary
decisions about organizing their own resources. It is also easy to see in Organiz­
ing Systems created by institutions like libraries, museums, businesses, and
governments where the responsibility and authority to organize is centralized
and explicit in policies, laws, or regulations.
However, top-down intentionality is not always necessary to create an Organiz­
ing system. Organization can emerge over time via collective behavior in situa­
tions without central control when decisions made by individuals, each acting
intentionally, create traces, records, or other information that accumulates over
time. Organizing systems that use bottom-up rather than top-down mechanisms
are sometimes called self-organizing, because they emerge from the aggregated
interactions of actors with resources or with each other. Self-organizing systems
can change their internal structure or their function in response to feedback or
changed circumstances.
This definition is broad enough to include business and biological ecosystems,
traffic patterns, and open-source software projects. Another good example of
emergent organization involves path systems, where people (as well as ants and
other animals) can follow and thereby reinforce the paths taken by their prede­
cessors. When highly orderly and optimal arrangements emerge from local in­
teractions among ants, bees, birds, fish, and other animal species, it is often
called “swarm intelligence.” When this happens with human ratings for news
stories, YouTube videos, restaurants, and other types of digital and physical re­
sources we call it “crowdsourcing.” What the animal and human situations have
in common is that information is being communicated between individuals.
Sometimes this communication is direct, as when Amazon shows you the aver­
age rating for a book or what books have been bought by people like you. At
other times the communication is indirect, achieved when the agents modify
their environment (as they do when they create paths) and others can respond
to these modifications. Adam Smith's “invisible hand” is another example where
individuals collectively generate an outcome they did not directly intend but
that arose from their separate self-interested actions as they respond to price
signals in the marketplace. Likewise, even though there is no top-down organi­
zation, the web as a whole, with its more than a trillion unique pages, is a selforganizing system that at its core follows clear organizing princi­
ples.12[Com] 13[Web] 14[IA]

The Web as an Organizing System
Today’s web barely resembles the system for distributing scientific and
technical reports it was designed to be when physicist and computer scien­
tist Tim Berners-Lee devised it in 1990 at the European Organization for
Nuclear Research (CERN) lab near Geneva. However, as an Organizing Sys­
tem the web still follows the principles that Berners-Lee defined at its crea­
tion. These include standard data formats and interaction protocols; no
need for centralized control of page creation or linking; remote access over
the network from anywhere; and the ability to run on a large variety of com­
puters and operating systems. This architecture makes the web open and
extensible, but gives it no built-in mechanisms for authority or trust.15[Web]
Because the web works without any central authority or authorship control,
any person or organization can add to it. As a result, even though the web
as a whole does not exhibit the centralized intentional arrangement of re­
sources that characterizes many Organizing Systems, we can view it as con­
sisting of millions of Organizing Systems that each embody a separate in­
tentional arrangement of web pages. In addition, we most often interact
with the web indirectly by using a search engine, which meets the definition
of Organizing System because its indexing and retrieval algorithms are
principled.
A great many Organizing Systems are implemented as collections of web
pages. Some of these collections are created on the web as new pages,
some are created by transforming existing collections of resources, and
some combine new and existing resources.
The requirement for intentional arrangement excludes naturally occurring pat­
terns created by physical or geological processes from being thought of as Or­
ganizing Systems. There is information in the piles of debris left after a tornado
or tsunami and the strata of the Grand Canyon. But they are not Organizing Sys­
tems because the patterns of arrangement were created by deterministic natu­
ral forces rather than by agents following one or more organizing principles. On
the other hand, collections of geological data like the measurements of chemical
composition from different strata and locations in the Grand Canyon are Organ­
izing Systems. Decisions about what to measure, how to combine and analyze
the measurements, and any theories that are tested or created, reflect inten­
tional arrangement of the data by the geologist.
Other patterns of resource arrangements are illusions or perceptions that re­
quire a particular vantage point. The best examples are patterns of stars as they
appear to an observer on Earth. The three precisely aligned stars, often descri­
bed as “Orion’s belt,” are hundreds of light years from Earth, and also from
each other. The perceived arrangement of the stars is undeniable, but the stars
1.5 The Concept of “Intentional Arrangement”

are not aligned in the universe. Astronomical constellations like Orion are inten­
tional arrangements imposed on our perceived locations of the stars, and these
perceived arrangements and the explanations for them that constellations pro­
vide, form an Organizing System that is deeply embedded in human culture and
in the practice of celestial navigation over the seas.

Not an Intentional Arrangement

The composition and arrangement of the rock layers (“strata”) in the Grand
Canyon in the Southwest United States have been studied extensively by
geologists. The composition of rock suggests the environment in which it
was formed, and the absolute and relative arrangement of the rock layers
reveals the timing of important geological events.

Taken together, the intentional arrangements of resources in an Organizing Sys­
tem are the result of decisions about what is organized, why it is organized, how
much it is organized, when it is organized, and how or by whom it is organized
(each of these will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 2). An Organizing
System is defined by the composite impact of the choices made on these design
dimensions. Because these questions are interrelated their answers come to­
gether in an integrated way to define an Organizing System.

1.6 The Concept of “Organizing Principle”
The arrangements of resources in an Organizing System follow or embody one
or more organizing principles that enable the Organizing System to achieve its
purposes. Organizing principles are directives for the design or arrangement of
a collection of resources that are ideally expressed in a way that does not as­
sume any particular implementation or realization. We call this design philoso­
phy “Architectural Thinking” (§11.5.2.)

Organizing Spices By Cuisine

An alternative to organizing spices alphabetically is to organize them ac­
cording to cuisines or flavor profiles, which can be defined in terms of in­
gredients and spices that tend to be used together. Patricia Glushko organi­
zes her spices into three groups: Indian (includes cayenne pepper, coriand­
er, cumin, turmeric), Mediterranean / Middle Eastern (includes basil, dill,
oregano, paprika, thyme), and seeds. Each group of spices is in a separate
large container, which makes it convenient when cooking.

1.6 The Concept of “Organizing Principle”

43

The Discipline of Organizing

When we organize a bookshelf, home office, kitchen, or the MP3 files on our mu­
sic player, the resources themselves might be new and modern but many of the
principles that govern their organization are those that have influenced the de­
sign of Organizing Systems for thousands of years. For example, we organize
many collections of resources using the properties that are easiest to perceive,
or whose values vary the most among the items in the collection, because these
principles make it easy to locate a particular resource. We also group together
resources that we often use together, we make resources that we use often
more accessible than those we use infrequently, and we put rare or unique re­
sources where we can protect them. Very general and abstract organizing prin­
ciples are sometimes called design heuristics (e.g., “make things easier to
find”). More specific and commonly used organizing principles include alphabet­
ical ordering (arranging resources according to their names) and chronological
ordering (arranging resources according to the date of their creation or other
important event in the lifetime of the resource). Some organizing principles sort
resources into pre-defined categories and other organizing principles rely on
novel combinations of resource properties to create new categories.
Because this book was motivated by the goal of broadening the study of infor­
mation organization beyond its roots in library and information science, it em­
phasizes organizing principles with a specific functional purpose like identify­
ing, selecting, retrieving, or preserving resources. However, for thousands of
years people have systematically collected things, information about those
things, and observations of all kinds, organizing them in an effort to understand
how their world works; the Babylonians created inventories and star charts; an­
cient Egyptians tracked the annual Nile floods; and, Mesoamericans created as­
tronomical calendars. The term sensemaking is often used to describe this ge­
neric and less specific purpose of organizing to derive meaning from experience
by fitting new events or observations into what they already know.16[CogSci]
Expressing organizing principles in a way that separates design and implemen­
tation aligns well with the three-tier architecture familiar to software architects
and designers: user interface (implementation of interactions), business logic
(intentional arrangement), and data (resources). (See the sidebar, The Three
Tiers of Organizing Systems (page 47).)
The logical separation between organizing principles and their implementation
is easy to see with digital resources. In a digital library it does not matter to a
user if the resources are stored locally or retrieved over a network. The essence
of a library Organizing System emerges from the resources that it organizes and
the interactions with the resources that it enables. Users typically care a lot
about the interactions they can perform, like the kinds of searching and sorting
allowed by the online library catalog. How the resources and interactions are
implemented are typically of little concern.

44

Chapter 1 — Foundations for Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

The separation of organizing principles and their implementation is harder to
recognize in an Organizing System that only contains physical resources, such
as your kitchen or clothes closet, where you appear to have unmediated interac­
tions with resources rather than accessing them through some kind of user in­
terface or “presentation tier” that supports the principles specified in the “mid­
dle tier” and realized in the “storage tier.” As a result, people can easily get dis­
tracted by presentation-tier concerns. Too often we waste time color-coding file
folders and putting labels on storage containers, when it would have better to
think more carefully about the logical organization of the folder and container
contents. It does not help to use colors and labels to make the logical organiza­
tion more salient if that is not well designed first.
One place where you can easily appreciate these different tiers for physical re­
sources is in the organization of spices in a kitchen. Different kitchens might all
embody an alphabetic order organizing principle for arranging a collection of
spices, but the exact locations and arrangement of the spices in any particular
kitchen depends on the configuration of shelves and drawers, whether a spice
rack or rotating tray is used, and other storage-tier considerations. Similarly,
spices could be logically organized by cuisine, with Indian spices separated
from Mexican spices, but this organizing principle does not imply anything
about where they can be found in the kitchen.
Figure 1.2, Presentation, Logic and Storage Tiers. illustrates the separation of the
presentation, logic, and storage tiers for four different types of library Organiz­
ing Systems and for Google Books. No two of them are the same in every tier.
Note how a library that uses inventory robots to manage the storage of books
does not reveal this in its higher tiers. (See the sidebar, Library Robot (page
127).)
Because tangible things can only be in one place at a time, many Organizing
Systems, like those in the modern library with online catalogs and physical col­
lections, resolve this constraint by creating digital proxies or surrogates to or­
ganize their tangible resources, or create parallel digital resources (e.g., digi­
tized books).17[Web] The implications for arranging, finding, using and reusing re­
sources in any Organizing System directly reflect the mix of these two embodi­
ments of information; in this way we can think of the modern library as a digital
Organizing System that primarily relies on digital resources to organize a mix­
ture of physical and digital ones.
The Organizing System for a small collection can sometimes use only the mini­
mal or default organizing principle of colocation—putting all the resources in
the same location: in the same container, on the same shelf, or in the same
email in-box. If you do not cook much and have only a small number of spices in
your kitchen, you do not need to alphabetize them because it is easy to find the
one you want.18[Com]

Figure 1.2. Presentation, Logic and Storage Tiers.

It is highly desirable when the design and implementation of an Organizing Sys­
tem separates the storage of the resources from the logic of their arrangement
and the methods for interacting with them. This three-tier architect is familiar
to designers of computerized Organizing Systems but it is also useful to think
about Organizing Systems in this way even when it involves physical resources.

Some organization emerges implicitly through a frequency of use principle. In
your kitchen or clothes closet, the resources you use most often migrate to the
front because that is the easiest place to return them after using them. But as a
collection grows in size, the time to arrange, locate, and retrieve a particular re­
source becomes more important. The collection must be explicitly organized to
make these interactions efficient, and the organization must be preserved after
the interaction takes place; i.e., resources are put back in the place they were

The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems
Software architects and designers agree that it is desirable to build applica­
tions that separate the storage of data, the business logic or functions that
use the data, and the user interface or presentation components through
which users or other applications interact with the data. This modular archi­
tecture allows each of the three tiers to be upgraded or reimplemented in­
dependently to satisfy changed requirements or to take advantage of new
technologies. An analogous distinction is that between an algorithm as a
logical description of a method for solving a computational problem and its
implementation in a particular programming language like Java or Python.
These architectural distinctions are equally important to librarians and in­
formation scientists. Our new way of looking at Organizing Systems empha­
sizes the importance of identifying the desired interactions with resources,
determining which organizing principles can enable the interactions, and
then deciding how to store and manage the resources according to those
principles. Applying architectural thinking to Organizing Systems makes it
easier to compare and contrast existing ones and design new ones. Separat­
ing the organizing principles in the “middle tier” from their implications in
the “data” and “presentation” tiers often makes it possible to implement the
same logical Organizing System in different environments that support the
same or equivalent interactions with the resources. For example, a new re­
quirement to support searching through a library catalog on a smart phone
would only affect the presentation tier.
found. As a result, most Organizing Systems employ organizing principles that
make use of properties of the resources being organized (e.g., name, color,
shape, date of creation, semantic or biological category), and multiple proper­
ties are often used simultaneously. For example, in your kitchen you might ar­
range your cooking pots and pans by size and shape so you can nest them and
store them compactly, but you might also arrange things by cuisine or style and
separate your grilling equipment from the wok and other items you use for mak­
ing Chinese food.
Unlike those for physical resources, the most useful organizing properties for
information resources are those that reflect their content and meaning, and
these are not directly apparent when you look at a book, document, or collec­
tion of data. Significant intellectual effort or statistical computation is necessary
to reveal these properties when assigning subject terms, creating an index, or
using them as input features for machine learning and data analysis programs.

Separation Of Organizing Principle From Implementation

Whether spices are organized alphabetically by their names, by cuisines, by
season, by frequency of use, or any other principle, this decision is logically
distinct from the physical arrangement of the spices. There are many types
of spice racks, shelves, circular “lazy susans,” and other devices designed
for arranging spices.
(Photo collage created by R. Glushko from various web catalogs.)

The most effective Organizing Systems for information resources often are
based on statistical properties that emerge from analyzing the collection as a
whole. For example, the relevance of documents to a search query is higher
when they contain a higher than average frequency of the query terms com­
pared to other documents in the collection, or when they are linked to relevant
documents. Likewise, algorithms for classifying email messages continuously re­
calculate the probability that words like “beneficiary” or “Viagra” indicate
whether a message is “spam” or “not spam” in the collection of messages pro­
cessed.

1.7 The Concept of “Agent”
Many disciplines have specialized job titles to distinguish among the people who
organize resources (for example: cataloger, archivist, indexer, curator, collec­
tions manager...). We use the more general word, agent, for any entity capable
of autonomous and intentional organizing effort, because it treats organizing
work done by people and organizing work done by computers as having com­
mon goals, despite obvious differences in methods.
We can analyze agents in Organizing Systems to understand how human and
computational efforts to arrange resources complement and substitute for each
other. We can determine the economic, social, and technological contexts in
which each type of agent can best be employed. We can determine how the Or­
ganizing System allocates effort and costs among its creators, users, maintain­
ers and other stakeholders.
A group of people can be an organizing agent, as when a group of people come
together in a service club or standards body technical committee in which the
members of the group subordinate their own individual agency to achieve a col­
lective good.
We also use the term agent when we discuss interactions with Organizing Sys­
tems. The entities that most typically access the contents of libraries, museums,
or other collections of physical resources are human agents—that is, people. In
other Organizing Systems, such as business information systems or data reposi­
tories, interactions with resources are carried out by computational processes,
robotic devices, or other entities that act autonomously on behalf of a person or
group.
In some Organizing Systems, the resources themselves are capable of initiating
interactions with other resources or with external agents. This is most obvious
with human or other living resources, where a critical part of the design of any
Organizing System with them is determining what kinds of interactions they
should be encouraged or allowed to initiate. We will return to this issue after we
discuss the design of interactions with ordinary resources that are passive, the
situation in most Organizing Systems that involve physical resources.
Other resources that can initiate interactions are resources augmented with
sensory, computational or communication capabilities that enable them to ob­
tain information from their environment and then do something useful with it.
You are probably familiar with RFID tags, which enable the precise identifica­
tion and location of physical resources as they move through supply chains and
stores, and with “smart” devices like Nest thermostats that learn how to pro­
gram themselves.

1.7 The Concept of “Agent”

49

The Discipline of Organizing

1.8 The Concept of “Interactions”
An interaction is an action, function, service, or capability that makes use of the
resources in a collection or the collection as a whole. The interaction of access
is fundamental in any collection of resources, but many Organizing Systems pro­
vide additional functions to make access more efficient and to support addition­
al interactions with the accessed resources. For example, libraries and similar
Organizing Systems implement catalogs to enable interactions for finding a
known resource, identifying any resource in the collection, and discriminating
or selecting among similar resources.
Some of the interactions with resources in an Organizing System are inherently
determined by the characteristics of the resource. Because many museum re­
sources are unique or extremely valuable, visitors are allowed to view them but
cannot borrow them, in contrast with most of the resources in libraries. A li­
brary might have multiple printed copies of Moby Dick but can never lend more
of them than it possesses. After a printed book is checked out from the library,
there are many types of interactions that might take place—reading, translat­
ing, summarizing, annotating, and so on—but these are not directly supported
by the library Organizing System and are invisible to it.
For works not in the public domain, copyright law gives the copyright holder the
right to prevent some uses, but at the same time “fair use” and similar copy­
right doctrines enable certain limited uses even for copyrighted works.21[Law]
Digital resources enable a greater range of interactions than physical ones. Any
number of people or processes can request a weather forecast from a webbased weather service because the forecast is not used up by the request and
the marginal cost of allowing another access is nearly zero. Furthermore, with
digital resources many new kinds of interactions can be enabled through appli­
cation software, web services, or application program interfaces (APIs) in the
Organizing System. In particular, translation, summarization, annotation, and
keyword suggestion are highly useful services that are commonly supported by
web search engines and other web applications. Similarly, an Organizing Sys­
tem with digital resources can implement a “keep everything up to date” inter­
action that automatically pushes current content to your browser.
But just as technology can enable interactions, it can prevent or constrain them.
If your collection of digital resources (ebooks or music, for example) is not stor­
ed on your own computer or device, a continuous Internet connection is a re­
quirement for access. In addition, access control policies and digital rights man­
agement (DRM) technology can limit the devices that can access the collection
and prevent copying, annotation and other actions that might otherwise be ena­
bled by the fair use doctrine.

50

Chapter 1 — Foundations for Organizing Systems

Interaction design is especially crucial for managing resources that have the ca­
pability to initiate interactions with each other or with external agents. Consid­
er the vast differences in how workers behave in businesses organized accord­
ing to principles of scientific management and those that embody the Kaizen
principles of continuous improvement. In the former, work is highly standar­
dized and bureaucratic, giving workers little autonomy. In the latter, work is al­
so standardized, but workers are motivated to analyze and improve work pro­
cesses whenever possible, and they are given great discretion in how to do
that.22[Bus]
Just as with organizing principles, it is useful to think of interactions in an ab­
stract or logical way that does not assume an implementation because it can en­
courage innovative designs for Organizing Systems.

1.9 The Concept of “Interaction Resource”
Interactions with physical resources sometimes leave traces or other evidence.
Many of these traces are unintentional, like fingerprints, a coffee cup stain on a
newspaper, or the erosion on a shortcut path across a lawn. Fans of Sherlock
Holmes and CSI know that clever forensic investigators can use these residues
of interactions to identify or vindicate suspects. Other interaction traces are in­
tentional, like a student's yellow highlighting or notes in a textbook or spraypainted graffiti on a building. But not every interaction leaves a trace, traces
fade over time, and different traces associated with the same resource lack con­
sistency. This means that most traces are not of much use.
However, when Organizing Systems contain digital resources, or physical re­
sources that have sensing, recording, or communication capabilities, interaction
traces can be made predictable, persistent, and consistent. Each record of a
user choice in accessing, browsing, buying, highlighting, linking, and other in­
teractions then becomes an “interaction resource” that can be analyzed to reor­
ganize the resource collection or otherwise influence subsequent interactions
with the primary resources.
Interaction resources are often essential pieces of information that make Organ­
izing Systems function. Most human toll-takers have been replaced by smart
“toll tags” that broadcast their identity when the car they are in passes a radio
receiver at a tolling location. Each interaction resource created identifies an ac­
count and credit card with which to pay the toll; taken together, the collection
of these interaction resources can be used as the primary resources in other Or­
ganizing Systems that manage traffic congestion, or that support road design.
Similarly, interaction resources created by search engines can be used to adjust
the order of search hits, select ads, or personalize the content of web pages.

1.10 Organizing This Book
Devising concepts, methods, and technologies for describing and organizing re­
sources have been essential human activities for millennia, evolving both in re­
sponse to human needs and to enable new ones. Organizing Systems enabled
the development of civilization, from agriculture and commerce to government
and warfare. Today Organizing Systems are embedded in every domain of pur­
poseful activity, including research, education, law, medicine, business, science,
institutional memory, sociocultural memory, governance, public accountability,
as well as in the ordinary acts of daily living.
With the World Wide Web and ubiquitous digital information, along with effec­
tively unlimited processing, storage and communication capability, millions of
people create and browse websites, blog, tag, tweet, and upload and download
content of all media types without thinking “I am organizing now” or “I am re­
trieving now.” Writing a book used to mean a long period of isolated work by an
author followed by the publishing of a completed artifact, but today some books
are continuously and iteratively written and published through the online inter­
actions of authors and readers. When people use their smart phones to search
the web or run applications, location information transmitted from their phone
is used to filter and reorganize the information they retrieve. Arranging results
to make them fit the user’s location is a kind of computational curation, but be­
cause it takes place quickly and automatically we hardly notice it.
Likewise, almost every application that once seemed predominantly about infor­
mation retrieval is now increasingly combined with activities and functions that
most would consider to be information organization. Google, Microsoft, and oth­
er search engine operators have deployed millions of computers to analyze bil­
lions of web pages and millions of books and documents to enable the almost in­
stantaneous retrieval of published or archival information. However, these firms
increasingly augment this retrieval capability with information services that or­
ganize information in close to real-time. Further, the selection and presentation
of search results, advertisements, and other information can be tailored for the
person searching for information using his implicit or explicit preferences, loca­
tion, or other contextual information.
Taken together, these innovations in technology and its application mean that
the distinction between information organization and information retrieval that
is often manifested in academic disciplines and curricula is much less important
than it once was.

This book has few sharp divisions between information organization (IO) and in­
formation retrieval (IR) topics. Instead, it explains the key concepts and chal­
lenges in the design and deployment of Organizing Systems in a way that con­
tinuously emphasizes the relationships and tradeoffs between IO and IR. The
concept of the Organizing System highlights the design dimensions and deci­
sions that collectively determine the extent and nature of resource organization
and the capabilities of the processes that compare, combine, transform and in­
teract with the organized resources.

Navigating The Discipline of Organizing
Chapter 2, Design Decisions in Organizing Systems
This chapter introduces six broad design questions or dimensions whose in­
tertwined answers define an Organizing System: What, why, how much,
when, how, and where. This framework for describing and comparing Organ­
izing Systems overcomes the biases and conservatism built into familiar cat­
egories like libraries and museums while enabling us to describe them as de­
sign patterns. We can then use these patterns to support inter-disciplinary
work that cuts across categories and applies knowledge about familiar do­
mains to unfamiliar ones.
Chapter 3, Activities in Organizing Systems
Developing a view that brings together how we organize as individuals with
how libraries, museums, governments, research institutions, and businesses
create Organizing Systems requires that we generalize the organizing con­
cepts and methods from these different domains. Chapter 3 surveys a wide
variety of Organizing Systems and describes four activities or functions
shared by all of them: selecting resources, organizing resources, designing
resource-based interactions and services, and maintaining resources over
time.
Chapter 4, Resources in Organizing Systems
The design of an Organizing System is strongly shaped by what is being or­
ganized, the first of the six design decisions we introduced earlier in
§2.2 What Is Being Organized? (page 64). To enable a broad perspective on
this fundamental issue we use resource to refer to anything being organized,
an abstraction that we can apply to physical things, digital things, informa­
tion about either of them, or web-based services or objects. Chapter 4 dis­
cusses the challenges and methods for identifying the resources in an Or­
ganizing System in great detail and emphasizes how these decisions reflect
the goals and interactions that must be supported—the “why” design deci­
sions introduced in §2.3 Why Is It Being Organized? (page 66).

Chapter 5, Resource Description and Metadata
The principles by which resources are organized and the kinds of services
and interactions that can be supported for them largely depend on the na­
ture and explicitness of the resource descriptions. This “how much descrip­
tion” design question was introduced in §2.4 How Much Is It Being Organ­
ized? (page 70); Chapter 5 presents a systematic process for creating effec­
tive descriptions and analyzes how this general approach can be adapted for
different types of Organizing Systems.
Chapter 6, Describing Relationships and Structures
An important aspect of organizing a collection of resources is describing the
relationships between them. Chapter 6 introduces the specialized vocabulary
used to describe semantic relationships between resources and between the
concepts and words used in resource descriptions. It also discusses the
structural relationships within multipart resources and between resources,
like those expressed as citations or hypertext links.
Chapter 7, Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types
Groups or sets of resources with similar or identical descriptions can be
treated as equivalent, making them members of an equivalence class or cat­
egory. Identifying and using categories are essential human activities that
take place automatically for perceptual categories like “red things” or
“round things.” Categorization is deeply ingrained in language and culture,
and we use linguistic and cultural categories without realizing it, but catego­
rization can also be a deeply analytic and cognitive process. Chapter 7 re­
views theories of categorization from the point of view of how categories are
created and used in Organizing Systems.
Chapter 8, Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories
The terms categorization and classification are often used interchangeably
but they are not the same. Classification is applied categorization—the as­
signment of resources to a system of categories, called classes, using a pre­
determined set of principles. Chapter 8 discusses the broad range of how
classifications are used in Organizing Systems. These include enumerative
classification, faceted classification, activity-based classification, and compu­
tational classification. Because classification and standardization are closely
related, the chapter also analyzes standards and standards-making as they
apply to Organizing Systems.

Chapter 9, The Forms of Resource Descriptions
Chapter 9 complements the conceptual and methodological perspective on
the creation of resource descriptions with an implementation perspective.
Chapter 9 reviews a range of metamodels for structuring descriptions, with
particular emphasis on XML, JSON, and RDF. It concludes by comparing and
contrasting three “worlds of description” —document processing, the web,
and the Semantic Web—where each of these three metamodels is most ap­
propriate.
Chapter 10, Interactions with Resources
When Organizing Systems overlap, intersect, or are combined (temporarily
or permanently), differences in resource descriptions can make it difficult or
impossible to locate resources, access them, or otherwise impair their use.
Chapter 10 reviews some of the great variety of concepts and techniques
that different domains use when interacting with resources in Organizing
Systems—integration, interoperability, data mapping, crosswalks, mash-ups,
and so on. Interactions are characterized by the layers of resource proper­
ties they use: instance, collection-based, derived, or properties combined
from different resources. Chapter 10 extends the idea of an information or­
ganization—information retrieval continuum, and describes information re­
trieval interactions (and others) in terms of information organization (i.e.,
resource description) requirements.
Chapter 11, The Organizing System Roadmap
Chapter 11 complements the descriptive perspective of chapters 2-10 with a
more prescriptive one that analyzes the design choices and tradeoffs that
must be made in different phases in an Organizing System’s life cycle. Sys­
tem life cycle models exhibit great variety, but we use a generic four-phase
model that distinguishes a domain identification and scoping phase, a re­
quirements phase, a design and implementation phase, and an operational
phase.
Chapter 12, Case Studies
In Chapter 12 we use the model described in Chapter 11 to guide the analy­
sis of studies that span the range of Organizing Systems, and make refer­
ence to the principles, guidelines, vocabulary, and models discussed in the
preceding chapters.

The DIKW hierarchy seems to have been inspired by The Rock, A Pageant
Play (Eliot 1934) by the poet T S Eliot, whose opening chorus contains these
lines:

Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?
Most people credit Ackoff’s From Data to Wisdom (Ackoff 1989) as the first ar­
ticulation of the hierarchy in an information science and systems context. The
hierarchy is mentioned in nearly twenty textbooks, but their close analysis by
(Rowley 2007) reveals only partial agreement on the definitions and relation­
ships among the four key concepts. The hierarchy has been criticized as lacking
in philosophical rigor (Fricke 2009) and for ignoring the context-specificity of
how knowledge is learned and applied (Jennex 2009). (Larose 2014)
Siegel’s Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict who will Click, Buy, Lie
or Die” (Siegel 2013) is written for a non-technical audience and enthusiastical­
ly describes over 100 applications. The Master Algorithm (Domingos 2015)
shares Siegel’s enthusiasm but is far more technical; the book attempts to ex­
plain and compare the five “tribes” of machine learning: the symbolists, connec­
tionists, evolutionaries, Bayesians, and analogizers. The title of Chris Ander­
son’s provocative article in Wired Magazine (Anderson, 2008) is selfexplanatory: “The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method
obsolete.”

“Difference in kind or difference in degree” is an important issue in legal con­
texts and more generally arises whenever there is a disagreement about wheth­
er some difference or change is strict and categorical or whether it is incremen­
tal. We introduce it here so that readers can think critically about the sociobusiness-technical changes that might come about as a result of new methods
and technologies for organizing and analyzing data. We believe that data sci­
ence is on its way to becoming an important part of the organizing tool box. But
everyone needs to remember that humans own the tool box, and that they de­
sign and build the tools..
The URI identifies a resource as an abstract entity that can have “multiple
representations,” which are the “things” that are actually exposed through ap­
plications or user interfaces. The HTTP protocol can transfer the representation
that best satisfies the content properties specified by a web client, most often a
browser. This means that interactions with web resources are always with their
representations rather than directly with the resource per se. The representa­
[8][Web]

56

tion of the resource might seem to be implied by the URI (as when it ends
in .htm or .html to suggest text in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format),
but the URI is not required to indicate anything about the “representation.” A
web resource can be a static web page, but it can also be dynamic content gen­
erated at the time of access by a program or service associated with the URI.
Some resources like geolocations have “no representations at all;” the resource
is simply some point or space and the interaction is “show me how to get there.”
The browser and web server can engage in “content negotiation” to determine
which “representation” to retrieve, and this is particularly important when that
format further requires an external application or “plug-in” in order for it to be
rendered properly, as it does when the server returns a Power Point file or an
other file format that is not built into the browser.
Internet architecture’s definition of resource as a conceptual entity that is never
directly interacted with is difficult for most people to apply when those resour­
ces are physical or tangible objects, because then it surely seems like we are in­
teracting with something real. So we will most often talk about interactions with
resources, and will mention “resource representations” only when it is necessa­
ry to align precisely with the narrower Internet architecture sense.
In addition, groups of people have come together to form “intentional
communities” for thousands of years in monasteries, communes, artist colonies,
cooperative houses, and religious or ethnic enclaves so they can live with peo­
ple who share their values and beliefs. A directory of intentional communities
organized by type and location is managed by the Fellowship of Intentional
Communities.

[9][Phil]

The shift from a manufacturing to an information and services economy
in the last few decades has resulted in greater emphasis on intellectual resour­
ces represented in skills and knowledge rather than on the natural resources of
production materials and physical goods.
[10][Bus]

The intellectual resources of a firm are embodied in a firm’s people, systems,
management techniques, history of strategy and design decisions, customer re­
lationships, and intellectual property like patents, copyrights, trademarks, and
brands. Some of this knowledge is explicit, tangible, and traceable in the form
of documents, databases, organization charts, and policy and procedure man­
uals. But much of it is tacit: informal and not systematized in tangible form be­
cause it is held in the minds and experiences of people; a synonym is “knowhow.” A more modern term is Intellectual Capital, a concept originated in a
1997 book with that title (Stewart 1997).
In 2004, Google began digitizing millions of books from several major re­
search libraries with the goal of making them available through its search en­

author’s organization. In 2011 a US District Court judge rejected the proposed
settlement the parties had negotiated in 2008 because many others objected to
it, including the US Justice Department, several foreign governments, and nu­
merous individuals (Samuelson 2011).
The major reason for the rejection was that the settlement was a “bridge too
far” that went beyond the claims made against Google to address issues that
were not in litigation. In particular, the judge objected to the treatment of the
so-called “orphan works” that were still under copyright but out of print be­
cause money they generated went to the parties in the settlement and not to the
rights holders who could not be located (why the books are “orphans”) or to de­
fray the costs of subscriptions to the digital book collection. The judge also was
concerned that the settlement did not adequately address the concerns of aca­
demic authors—who wrote most of the books scanned from research libraries—
who might prefer to make their books freely available rather than seek to maxi­
mize profits from them. Other concerns were that the settlement would have en­
trenched Google’s monopoly in the search market and that there were inade­
quate controls for protecting the privacy of readers.
Google’s plan would have dramatically increased access to out of print books,
and the rejection of the proposed settlement has heightened calls for an open
public digital library (Darnton 2011). A good start toward such a library was the
digital copies that the research libraries received in return for giving Google
books to scan, which were collected and organized by the Hathi Trust In 2010,
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation provided funding to launch the Digital Public Li­
brary of America (DPLA): http://dp.la/. This non-proprietary goal might induce
the US Congress and other governments to pass legislation that fixes the copy­
right problems for orphan works.
Self-organizing is also used to describe phenomena like climate, neural
networks, and phase transitions and equilibrium states in physics and chemis­
try. But when systems involve collections of inanimate resources that are very
large and open, with complex interactions among the resources, it seems less
sensible to attribute intentional arrangement to the outcomes. The resource ar­
rangements that emerge cannot always be interpreted as the result of intention­
al or deterministic principles and instead are more often described in probabil­
istic or statistical terms. And even though it involves animate resources, Charles
Darwin’s “natural selection” in evolutionary biology is a self-organizing mecha­
nism where intentionality is hard to pinpoint or absent entirely.
[12][Com]

The rules governing these local interactions can be simple and yet produce
highly complex structures. For example, in flocks of birds or schools of fish the
rules are: (1) follow things like you, (2) do not bump into each other, but stay
close, and (3) move in the same direction as the rest of the group. With just
these three rules computer models can create complex three-dimensional ar­

rangements that can make abrupt changes in shape and density while moving
rapidly, just as live things do. (Friederici 2009)
The term “Crowdsourcing” was invented by Jeff Howe in a June 2006 article in
Wired magazine, and the concept was developed further in a book published
two years later (Howe 2006, 2008). “Folksonomy” was coined by Thomas Van
der Wal at about the same time in 2004; see http://vanderwal.net/folksono

Self-organizing behaviors in ants, bees, bats, cuckoos, fireflies and other ani­

The concept of a web page is imprecise because many web pages, espe­

The “plain web” (Wilde 2008a), whose evolution is managed by the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is rigorously standardized, but unfortunately the
larger ecosystem of technologies and formats in which the web exists is becom­

mats and players (like Flash) or are implemented as closed environments that
are intentionally isolated from the rest of the web (like Facebook or Apple’s
iTunes and other smart phone “app stores”).

Instead of thinking of a digital book as a “parallel resource” to a printed

and function can be understood by text-only readers.

For example, if the collection is arranged in an unorganized or random manner
(as a “pile”) and every resource must be examined, the time to find a particular
item increases linearly with the collection size. If the collection is maintained in
an ordered manner, a binary search algorithm can locate any item in a time pro­
portional to the logarithm of the number of items. Analysis of algorithms is a
fundamental topic in computer science; a popular textbook is Introduction to Al­
gorithms by (Cormen et al. 2009).
Copyright law, license or contract agreements, terms of use and so on
that shape interactions with resources are part of the Organizing System, but

With digital resources, digital rights management (DRM), passwords, and other

Frederick Taylor developed “scientific management” to improve industri­

thought were optimal ways to perform work tasks (Taylor 1914). The Kaizen
principles of continuous improvement were introduced to Western audiences by
Imai Masaaki and by numerous books about their application in the Toyota pro­
duction system (Masaaki 1986).
[22][Bus]

Scientific management views a business as a machine, while Kaizen principles
treat it as a brain that learns. These metaphors for business organization are
among those described by (Morgan 1997) in a classic business textbook. Other
metaphors discussed include organisms, cultures, political systems, and psychic
prisons.

2.1 Introduction
A set of resources is transformed by an organizing system when the resources
are described or arranged to enable interactions with them. Explicitly or by de­
fault, this requires many interdependent decisions about the identities of re­
sources; their names, descriptions and other properties; the classes, relations,
structures and collections in which they participate; and the people or technolo­
gies interacting with them.
One important contribution of the idea of the organizing system is that it moves
beyond the debate about the definitions of “things,” “documents,” and “informa­
tion,” with the unifying concept of “resource” while acknowledging that “what is
being organized” is just one of the questions or dimensions that need to be con­
sidered. These decisions are deeply intertwined, but it is easier to introduce
them as if they were independent.
We introduce six groups of design questions, itemizing the most important di­
mensions in each group:

The Discipline of Organizing

• What is being organized? What is the scope and scale of the domain? What
is the mixture of physical things, digital things, and information about things
in the organizing system? Is the organizing system being designed to create
a new resource collection, catalog an existing and closed resource collec­
tion, or manage a collection in which resources are continually added or de­
leted? Are the resources unique, or are they interchangeable members of a
category? Do they follow a predictable “life cycle” with a “useful life”? Does
the organizing system use the interaction resources created through its use,
or are these interaction resources extracted and aggregated for use by an­
other organizing system? (§2.2)
• Why is it being organized? What interactions or services will be supported,
and for whom? Are the uses and users known or unknown? Are the users pri­
marily people or computational processes? Does the organizing system need
to satisfy personal, social, or institutional goals? (§2.3)
• How much is it being organized? What is the extent, granularity, or explicit­
ness of description, classification, or relational structure being imposed?
What organizing principles guide the organization? Are all resources organ­
ized to the same degree, or is the organization sparse and non-uniform?
(§2.4)
• When is it being organized? Is the organization imposed on resources when
they are created, when they become part of the collection, when interactions
occur with them, just in case, just in time, all the time? Is any of this organ­
izing mandated by law or shaped by industry practices or cultural tradition?
(§2.5)
• How or by whom, or by what computational processes, is it being organ­
ized? Is the organization being performed by individuals, by informal groups,
by formal groups, by professionals, by automated methods? Are the organiz­
ers also the users? Are there rules or roles that govern the organizing activi­
ties of different individuals or groups? (§2.6)
• Where is it being organized? Is the resource location constrained by design
or by regulation? Are the resources positioned in a static location? Are the
resources in transit or in motion? Does their location depend on other pa­
rameters, such as time? (§2.7)
How well these decisions coalesce in an organizing system depends on the re­
quirements and goals of its human and computational users, and on understand­
ing the constraints and tradeoffs that any set of requirements and goals impose.
How and when these constraints and tradeoffs are handled can depend on the
legal, business, and technological contexts in which the organizing system is de­
signed and deployed; on the relationship between the designers and users of
the organizing system (who may be the same people or different ones); on the
62

Chapter 2 — Design Decisions in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

economic or emotional or societal purpose of the organizing system; and on nu­
merous other design, deployment, and use factors.
Classifying organizing systems according to the kind of resources they contain
is the most obvious and traditional approach. We can also classify organizing
systems by their dominant purposes, by their intended user community, or other
ways. No single fixed set of categories is sufficient by itself to capture the com­
monalities and contrasts between organizing systems.
We can augment the categorical view of organizing systems by thinking of them
as existing in a multi-faceted or multi-dimensional design space in which we can
consider many types of collections at the same time.
This framework for describing and comparing organizing systems overcomes
some of the biases and conservatism built into familiar categories like libraries,
museums, and archives, while enabling us to describe them as design patterns
that embody characteristic configurations of design choices. We can then use
these patterns to support inter-disciplinary work that cuts across categories and
applies knowledge about familiar domains to unfamiliar ones. A dimensional
perspective makes it easier to translate between category- and disciplinespecific vocabularies so that people from different disciplines can have mutually
intelligible discussions about their organizing activities. They might realize that
they have much in common, and they might be working on similar or even the
same problems.
A faceted or dimensional perspective acknowledges the diversity of instances of
collection types and provides a generative, forward-looking framework for de­
scribing hybrid types that do not cleanly fit into the familiar categories. Even
though it might differ from the conventional categories on some dimensions, an
organizing system can be designed and understood by its family resemblance on
the basis of its similarities on other dimensions to a familiar type of resource
collection.
Thinking of organizing systems as points or regions in a design space makes it
easier to invent new or more specialized types of collections and their associ­
ated interactions. If we think metaphorically of this design space as a map of or­
ganizing systems, the empty regions or “white space” between the denselypopulated centers of the traditional categories represent organizing systems
that do not yet exist. We can consider the properties of an organizing system
that could occupy that white space and analyze the technology, process, or poli­
cy innovations that might be required to let us build it there. We can reason by
analogy to identify and apply the principles used in one organizing system to un­
derstand or design others.

2.1 Introduction

The Discipline of Organizing

2.2 What Is Being Organized?
“What is difficult to identify is difficult to describe and therefore difficult
to organize.”
— (Svenonius 2000, p. 13)

Before we can begin to organize any resource we often need to identify it. It
might seem straightforward to devise an organizing system around tangible re­
sources, but we must be careful not to assume what a resource is. In different
situations, the same “thing” can be treated as a unique item, one of many equiv­
alent members of a broad category, or a component of an item rather than as an
item on its own. For example, in a museum collection, a handmade, carved
chess piece might be a separately identified item, identified as part of a set of
carved chess pieces, or treated as one of the 33 unidentified components of an
item identified as a chess set (including the board). When merchants assign a
stock-keeping unit (SKU) to identify the things they sell, that SKU can be associ­
ated with a unique item, sets of items treated as equivalent for inventory or bill­
ing purposes, or intangible things like warranties.
You probably do not have explicit labels on the cabinets and drawers in your
kitchen or clothes closet, but department stores and warehouses have signs in
the aisles and on the shelves because of the larger number of things a store
needs to organize. As a collection of resources grows, it often becomes necessa­
ry to identify each one explicitly; to create surrogates like bibliographic records
or descriptions that distinguish one resource from another; and to create addi­
tional organizational mechanisms like shelf labels, store directories, library card
catalogs and indexes that facilitate understanding the collection and locating
the resources it contains. These organizational mechanisms often suggest or
parallel the organizing principles used to organize the collection itself.
Organization mechanisms like aisle signs, store directories and library card cat­
alogs are embedded in the same physical environment as the resources being
organized. But when these mechanisms or surrogates are digitized, the new ca­
pabilities that they enable create design challenges. This is because a digital or­
ganizing system can be designed and operated according to more abstract and
less constraining principles than an organizing system that only contains physi­
cal resources. A single physical resource can only be in one place at a time, and
interactions with it are constrained by its size, location, and other properties. In
contrast, digital copies and surrogates can exist in many places at once and ena­
ble searching, sorting, and other interactions with an efficiency and scale im­
possible for tangible things.
When the resources being organized consist of information content, deciding on
the unit of organization is challenging because it might be necessary to look be­
64

Chapter 2 — Design Decisions in Organizing Systems

yond physical properties and consider conceptual or intellectual equivalence. A
high school student told to study Shakespeare’s play Macbeth might treat any
printed copy or web version as equivalent, and might even try to outwit the
teacher by watching a film adaptation of the play. To the student, all versions of
Macbeth seem to be the same resource, but librarians and scholars make much
finer distinctions.
An increasing number of organizing systems handle resources that are born dig­
ital. Ideally, digital texts can be encoded with explicit markup that captures
structural boundaries and content distinctions, which can be used to facilitate
organization, retrieval, or both. In practice the digital representations of texts
are often just image scans that do not support much processing or interaction. A
similar situation exists for the digital representations of music, photographs,
videos, and other non-text content like sensor data, where the digital formats
are structurally and semantically opaque.
This book does not emphasize systems that organize people, but it would be re­
miss not to mention them. Businesses organize their employees, schools organ­
ize their faculties and students, sports leagues and teams organize their play­
ers, and governments organize their citizens and residents to enable them to
vote, drive, attend schools, and receive medical care and other benefits. Data
scientists in all of these fields increasingly predict how employees, students,
athletes, voters, drivers - and other categories of people defined by intrinsic or
derived characteristics - will behave, decide, live, or die. Once people die, it is
no longer necessary to predict anything about them, but nonetheless cemeteries
are highly organized.
We often think and talk about time as a resource, and time fits the definition of
“anything of value that supports goal-oriented activity” from §1.3. Furthermore,
we could think of the calendar and clock as organizing systems that define time
at different levels of granularity to support different kinds of interactions. How­
ever, it is probably more useful to think of time as a constraint that influences
how and how much to organize.
If you're sorting your own mail, you can question whether the time you spend on
sorting is worth the time you save on searching. But at scale—imagine 10 mil­
lion books in a library—the considerable effort required to organize resources
saves vastly more time for the many users of the system over its lifetime. Note
the inherent tradeoff between time spent on organizing versus retrieval; this
will be a recurring theme throughout this book. In a personal context the trade­
off is a matter of individual need or preference, but in social or institutional con­
texts organization and retrieval are generally done by different people, and
their time is likely valued in different ways by the system owner.

2.2 What Is Being Organized?

The Discipline of Organizing

Computational Descriptions of People
Each of us is associated with a great many computational descriptions,
some of which are used almost every day to make predictions about our be­
havior using a variety of statistical techniques that are collectively called
“predictive analytics.” Whenever you use a credit card, fraud detection al­
gorithms use a model derived from your purchase history to decide, in frac­
tions of a second, whether the transaction is being initiated by you, or by
someone who has stolen your card. When you want to buy something expen­
sive on credit, the seller consults your credit score—based on what you owe,
your payment history, how long you have had credit, the kinds of credit you
have, and other factors—to predict whether you are a good credit risk, and
your credit score then gets adjusted if the seller decides to give you credit.
Then, after you have bought that expensive item, the seller's predictive
model can use that information to suggest other things you might want to
buy.
Philosophers have long debated the extent to which observations of a per­
son’s behavior can yield an understanding of their true and unobservable
nature. But whether or not computational descriptions capture a person's
essence, there is no escaping them. If you want to get life or car insurance
or a mortgage, models determine what you have to pay. Predictive models
are being used to admit people to college, to hire them, to draft or trade
them in professional sports, and to decide whether to monitor them closely
because they might be planning a terrorist act. Some companies use “peo­
ple analytics” software that analyzes every email, calendar item, and docu­
ment created by employees to build a model of what they know, what they
do, when they do it, and who they work with—the goal being to improve
communication and collaboration within the firm and with customers.

2.3 Why Is It Being Organized?
“The central purpose of systems for organizing information [is] bringing
like things together and differentiating among them.”
— (Svenonius 2000 p. xi)

Almost by definition, the essential purpose of any organizing system is to de­
scribe or arrange resources so they can be located and accessed later. The or­
ganizing principles needed to achieve this goal depend on the types of resour­
ces or domains being organized, and in the personal, social, or institutional set­
ting in which organization takes place.
Organizing systems can be distinguished by their dominant purposes or the pri­
ority of their common purposes. Libraries, museums, and archives are often
66

classified as memory institutions to emphasize their primary emphasis on re­
source preservation. In contrast, “management information systems” or “busi­
ness systems” are categories that include the great variety of software applica­
tions that implement the organizing systems needed to carry out day-to-day
business operations.
“Bringing like things together” is an informal organizing principle for many or­
ganizing systems. Almost as soon as libraries were invented over two thousand
years ago, the earliest librarians saw the need to develop systematic methods
for arranging and inventorying their collections. The invention of mechanized
printing in the fifteenth century, which radically increased the number of books
and periodicals, forced libraries to begin progressively more refined efforts to
state the functional requirements for their organizing systems and to be explicit
about how they met those requirements.
Today, any information-driven enterprise must have systematic processes and
technologies in place that govern information creation or capture and then man­
age its entire life cycle. Commercial firms need processes for transacting with
customers or other firms to carry out business operations, to support research
and innovation, marketing, and to develop business strategy and tactics in com­
pliance with laws and regulations for accounting, taxes, human resources, data
retention, and so on. In large firms these functions are so highly specialized and
complex that the different types of organizing systems have distinct names: En­
terprise Resource Planning (ERP), Enterprise Content Management (ECM), En­
terprise Data Management (EDM) Supply Chain Management (SCM), Records
Management, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Business Intelligence
(BI), Knowledge Management (KM), and so on. And even though the most im­
portant functions in the organizing systems of large enterprises are those that
manage the information resources needed for its business operation, these firms
might also need to maintain corporate libraries and archives.
Preserving documents in their physical or original form is the primary purpose
of archives and similar organizing systems that contain culturally, historically, or
economically significant documents that have value as long-term evidence. Pres­
ervation is also an important motivation for the organizing systems of
information- and knowledge-intensive firms, where information is primarily in
digital formats. Businesses and governmental agencies are usually required by
law to keep records of financial transactions, decision-making, personnel mat­
ters, and other information essential to business continuity, compliance with
regulations and legal procedures, and transparency. As with archives, it is some­
times critical that these business knowledge or records management systems
can retrieve the original documents, although digital copies that can be authen­
ticated are increasingly being accepted as legally equivalent.

2.3 Why Is It Being Organized?

The Discipline of Organizing

This discussion of the requirements for organizing resources in memory institu­
tions and businesses might convey the impression that storing and retrieving re­
sources efficiently are paramount goals, and indeed they are in many contexts.
But there are many other reasons for organizing resources, as is easily seen
when we look at personal organizing systems. And there are many other ways to
compare organizing systems than just how efficiently they enable storing and
retrieval functions.
An overarching goal when people are organizing their personal resources is to
minimize the effort needed to find the resources. But unlike the finding task in
institutional organizing systems, which is generally facilitated with external re­
source descriptions, finding aids, classifications, search engines, and orientation
and navigation mechanisms, the finding task in personal organizing systems is
primarily a cognitive one: you need to remember where the resources are and
how they are arranged. Because each person has unique experiences and pref­
erences, it is not surprising that people often organize the same types of resour­
ces in different ways to make the organization easier to perceive and remember.
The resulting resource arrangements often emphasize aesthetic or emotional
goals, as when books or clothes are arranged by color or preference, or behav­
ioral goals, as when most frequently used condiments and spices are kept on
the kitchen counter rather than stored in a pantry.
When individuals manage their papers, books, documents, record albums, com­
pact discs, DVDs, and other information resources, their organizing systems can
vary greatly. This is in part because the content of the resources being organ­
ized becomes a consideration. Furthermore, many of the organizing systems
used by individuals are implemented by web applications, and this makes them
more accessible than physical resources.27[Web]
Put another way, an information resource inherently has more potential uses
than resources like forks or frying pans, so it is not surprising that the organiz­
ing systems in offices are even more diverse than those in kitchens.
When the scale of the collection or the number of intended users increases, two
things can happen. The first is that if the system can turn its interaction traces
into interaction resources, additional value can be created by analyzing these
resources to enhance the interactions, to suggest new ones, or make predictions
about how individual users or groups of them will behave. Every business that
has a high volume of customer transactions does this; for example, a fast-food
restaurant would analyze time-stamped sales data, and might introduce a quick
pickup line for items that sell the most, or create product bundles that increase
sales while optimizing kitchen and counter work. Amazon.com and other retail­
ers that can capture detailed browsing traces can augment the sales data they
collect by treating items that were looked at but not purchased as potential

transactions, making them additional inputs to their sophisticated pricing and
recommendation systems.
A second likely outcome of increased scale or use is that not everyone is likely
to share the same goals and design preferences for the organizing system. If
you share a kitchen with housemates, you might have to negotiate and compro­
mise on some of the decisions about how the kitchen is organized so you can all
get along. In more formal or institutional organizing systems conflicts between
stakeholders can be much more severe, and the organizing principles and poli­
cies or permissions for the kinds of interactions available to different users
might even be specified in commercial contracts or governed by laws or stand­
ards. For example, Bowker and Star note that physicians view the creation of
patient records as central to diagnosis and treatment, insurance companies
think of them as evidence needed for payment and reimbursement, and re­
searchers think of them as primary data. These groups do not agree on the pri­
ority and quality requirements they assign to different information in the patient
record, and physicians understandably resist doing work that has no direct ben­
efit for them. Not surprisingly, policy making and regulations about patient re­
cords are highly contentious.
Once we acknowledge that stakeholders might not share the same goals, it is
clear that efficiency is too narrow a measure for evaluating organizing systems.
The ways that resources are organized and interacted with embody the priori­
ties and values of those designing the organizing system, yielding arrangements
and interactions designed to control or change the behaviors of the users. Put
more bluntly, resources are always organized in ways that are designed to allo­
cate value for some people (e.g., the owners of the resources, or the most fre­
quent users of them) and not for others. From the perspective of the other types
of user trying to interact with the system, this organization will likely seem un­
fair. In this way, organizing resources can often be seen as creating winners and
losers, providing benefits to the former and imposing costs or constraints on the
latter. For example, search engines analyze interaction resources to adjust
search results and choose an ad that is related to your latest query. These are
considered improved interactions from the perspective of the search engine, but
you might consider it a violation of your privacy and a bit creepy to have the tar­
geted ad follow you around the web until you click on it.
The emerging field of applied behavioral economics, popularized in books like
Freakonomics and Nudge, explains how subtle differences in resource arrange­
ment, the number and framing of choices, and default values can have substan­
tial effects on the decisions people make. Consider the arrangement of salads,
pasta dishes, bread, fish, meat, desserts and other types of food in a self-serve
cafeteria buffet. In a school setting, the food might be organized and presented
to encourage healthier eating, perhaps by making the fatty french fries and
high-calorie desserts hard to reach or by providing smaller trays and plates. The
2.3 Why Is It Being Organized?

69

The Discipline of Organizing

same foods would likely be organized differently in an all-you-can-eat restau­
rant, where the goal is to minimize food costs, with less expensive items like sal­
ads at the front of the line to ensure that trays and plates will already be full
when the customer gets to the more expensive items at the end of the line.29[Bus]
The organization of cafeteria buffets to shape user behavior might not seem sin­
ister. However, organizing systems can control behavior in ways that create or
perpetuate inequities among their users. This unfairness is a matter of degree:
a person who does not own a computer who goes to the public library to check
out a popular book loses out when the library enables patrons with computer
access to check out books online and assumes that everyone has an equal shot
at accessing books via the Internet.
Looking to a much more insidious organizing system, when the South African
government adopted Apartheid policies to classify and segregate people by
race, it systematized economic and political discrimination and great suffering
for the nonwhite population. (See the sidebar, Power and Politics in Organizing
(page 71).)
Chapter 8, Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories more fully explains
the different purposes for organizing systems, the organizing principles they
embody, and the methods for assigning resources to categories.

2.4 How Much Is It Being Organized?
“It is a general bibliographic truth that not all documents should be ac­
corded the same degree of organization.”
— (Svenonius 2000, p. 24)

Not all resources should be accorded the same degree of organization. In this
section we will briefly unpack this notion of degree of organization into three
important and related dimensions: the amount of description detail or organiza­
tion applied to each resource, the amount of organization of resources into
classes or categories, and the overall extent to which interactions in and be­
tween organizing systems are shaped by resource description and arrangement.
It is important to note that this section is not asking the question “how much
stuff is being organized?” but rather to what degree is the stuff being organized.
Another way to ask the same question is “how many organizing principles are at
work?” in this organizing system. Your closet might be arranged only by body
part covered and season; an online music store will organize resources by
genre, artist name, band name, album name, popularity, date released, and
maybe others. So we would say that the online music store is organized much
more than the closet, because more organizing principles are at work.

Power and Politics in Organizing
It is tempting to think of organizing systems and the technologies used to
implement them as neutral or objective in their goals and impacts, but it is
impossible to argue that the use of racial classification in apartheid South
Africa was not a conscious manifestation of prejudice. And even if making it
hard for school kids to find the junk food in the cafeteria buffet has health
benefits, it nevertheless reflects a paternalistic point of view that restricts
individual choices.
Organizing systems and technology are not developed in a vacuum, unen­
cumbered by politics or social context. As Langdon Winner underscores in
Do Artifacts Have Politics?, systems and technologies can be conscious man­
ifestations of the personal (and often political) biases of their creators. Be­
cause all people have different experiences and biases, even when they are
not conscious of them they influence the design and implementation of or­
ganizing systems in ways that can create or perpetuate inequalities.30[Phil]
Technology innovators whose expressed goals are to make something faster,
smaller, or cheaper are ignoring the potential for their innovations and auto­
mation to render certain types of work less viable and discriminate against
people who lack the technology or skills to use it. For example, Winner de­
scribes the inadvertent social and political consequences of the introduction
of mechanical tomato harvesters in California agriculture in the 1960s.
Their industry-wide adoption favored larger farms with more resources to
buy the expensive machines, resulting in the disappearance of small tomato
farms and large-scale changes to many rural communities whose economies
had relied on them.
Some may argue that the mechanical tomato harvester created massive
benefits by increasing productivity, but the determination that more effi­
cient tomato production is worth its consequences could be debated. In any
case, the debate cannot be answered with a definite yes or no, just as it can­
not be with whether the Internet is bad because it has eroded the need for
librarians, or whether Uber's clever technologies for matching drivers and
riders unfairly avoid the regulations imposed on the taxi industry. Affirming
the introduction of the mechanical tomato harvester, search engines, and
Uber in the name of productivity, progress, and efficiency is a political point
of view.
(See also §8.2.3 Classification Is Biased (page 408) and Chapter 11, The Or­
ganizing System Roadmap.)
(Chapter 5 and Chapter 7, more thoroughly address these questions about the
nature and extent of description in organizing systems.)

2.3 Why Is It Being Organized?

71

The Discipline of Organizing

Not all resources in a collection require the same degree of description for the
simple reason we discussed in §2.3 Why Is It Being Organized? (page 66): Organ­
izing systems exist for different purposes and to support different kinds of inter­
actions or functions. Let us contrast two ends of the “degree of description”
continuum. Many people use “current events awareness” or “news feed” appli­
cations that select news stories whose titles or abstracts contain one or more
keywords (Google Alert is a good example). This exact match algorithm is easy
to implement, but its all-or-none and one-item-at-a-time comparison misses any
stories that use synonyms of the keyword, that are written in languages differ­
ent from that of the keyword, or that are otherwise relevant but do not contain
the exact keyword in the limited part of the document that is scanned. However,
users with current events awareness goals do not need to see every news story
about some event, and this limited amount of description for each story and the
simple method of comparing descriptions are sufficient.
On the other hand, this simple organizing system is inadequate for the purpose
of comprehensive retrieval of all documents that relate to some concept, event,
or problem. This is a critical task for scholars, scientists, inventors, physicians,
attorneys and similar professionals who might need to discover every relevant
document in some domain. Instead, this type of organizing system needs rich
bibliographic and semantic description of each document, most likely assigned
by professional catalogers, and probably using terms from a controlled vocabu­
lary to enforce consistency in what descriptions mean.
Similarly, different merchants or firms might make different decisions about the
extent or granularity of description when they assign SKUs because of differen­
ces in suppliers, targeted customers, or other business strategies. If you take
your car to the repair shop because windshield wiper fluid is leaking, you might
be dismayed to find that the broken rubber seal that is causing the leak cannot
be ordered separately and you have to pay to replace the “wiper fluid reservoir”
for which the seal is a minor but vital part. Likewise, when two business appli­
cations try to exchange and merge customer information, integration problems
arise if one describes a customer as a single “NAME” component while the oth­
er separates the customer’s name into “TITLE,” “FIRSTNAME,” and “LAST­
NAME.”
Even when faced with the same collection of resources, people differ in how
much organization they prefer or how much disorganization they can tolerate. A
classic study by Tom Malone of how people organize their office workspaces and
desks contrasted the strategies and methods of “filers” and “pilers.” Filers
maintain clean desktops and systematically organize their papers into catego­
ries, while pilers have messy work areas and make few attempts at organiza­
tion. This contrast has analogues in other organizing systems and we can easily
imagine what happens if a “neat freak” and “slob” become roommates.31[CogSci]

72

Chapter 2 — Design Decisions in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

An equally wide range, from a little organization to a lot, can be seen in the or­
ganizing systems for businesses, armies, governments, or any other institutional
organizing systems for people. Organizations with broad scope and many people
usually have deep hierarchies and explicit reporting relationships with the CEO,
general, or president at the top with numerous layers of vice presidents, direc­
tors, department heads, and managers (or colonels, majors, captains, lieuten­
ants, and sergeants). Smaller organizations are more varied, with some embody­
ing multi-layered management, and some embracing a flatter arrangement with
fewer management levels, wider spans of authority, and more autonomy for indi­
vidual workers. Many start-up firms try to grow without any management struc­
ture at all in the belief that it makes them more innovative and nimble, but evi­
dence suggests that when no one is responsible for making decisions, the lack
of accountability results in poor decisions, or in no decisions at all even when
some were sorely needed.32[Bus]
In any case, when people have to do it, describing and organizing resources is
work. Stakeholders in an organizing system often have disagreements among
about how much organization is necessary because of the implications for who
performs the work and who derives the benefits, especially the economic ones.
Physicians prefer narrative descriptions and broad classification systems be­
cause they make it easier to create patient notes. In contrast, insurance compa­
nies and researchers want fine-grained “form-filling” descriptions and detailed
classifications that would make the physician’s work more onerous.33[Com]
The amount of resource description is always shaped by the currently available
technology for capturing, storing, and making use of it. Nineteenth century ge­
ologists and paleontologists typically recorded only general information about
the depth and surrounding geological features when they found fossils because
they had no technology for making more precise measurements and everything
they noted they had to record by hand. Today, vastly more detailed information
is recorded by instruments and exploited by sophisticated techniques for carbon
dating and 3D reconstruction.
Automatically generated descriptions are increasingly an alternative or comple­
ment to those created by people. “Smart” resources use sensors to capture in­
formation about themselves and their environments (see §4.3.4). Our own com­
puters and phones record information about our keystrokes, clicks, communica­
tions, and locations. Business and government computers analyze and index
most of the text and speech content that flows through and between our person­
al phones and computers. These indexes typically assign weights to the terms
according to calculations that consider the frequency and distribution of the
terms in both individual documents and in the collection as a whole to create a
description of what the documents are about. These descriptions of the docu­
ments in the collection are more consistent than those created by human organ­
izers. They allow for more complex query processing and comparison operations
2.4 How Much Is It Being Organized?

73

The Discipline of Organizing

by the retrieval functions in the organizing system. For example, query expan­
sion mechanisms can automatically add synonyms and related terms to the
search. Additionally, retrieved documents can be arranged by relevance, while
“citing” and “cited-by” links can be analyzed to find related relevant documents.
It is important to recognize the potential downside to automated resource de­
scription. A detailed description produced by sensors or computers can seem
more accurate or authoritative than a simpler one created by a human observer,
even if the latter would be more useful for the intended purposes. Moreover, the
more detailed the description, the greater the opportunity to use it for new pur­
poses. This might be desirable, as when a company realizes that it can crossand up-sell because it has been tracking every click in a web store to create a
collection of interaction resources. But it could be undesirable, because detailed
transaction data can be used to violate privacy and civil rights. It depends on
who controls the collected information and their incentives for using it or not
using it.
A second constraint on the degree of organization comes from the size of the
collection within the scope of the organizing system. Organizing more resources
requires more descriptions to distinguish any particular resource from the rest,
and more constraining organizing principles. Similar resources need to be grou­
ped or classified to emphasize the most important distinctions among the com­
plete set of resources in the collection. A small neighborhood restaurant might
have a short wine list with just ten wines, arranged in two categories for “red”
and “white” and described only by the wine’s name and price. In contrast, a
gourmet restaurant might have hundreds of wines in its wine list, which would
subdivide its “red” and “white” high-level categories into subcategories for
country, region of origin, and grape varietal. The description for each wine
might in addition include a specific vineyard from which the grapes were
sourced, the vintage year, ratings of the wine, and tasting notes.
At some point a collection grows so large that it is not economically feasible for
people to create bibliographic descriptions or to classify each separate re­
source, unless there are so many users of the collection that their aggregated
effort is comparably large; this is organizing by “crowdsourcing.” This leaves
two approaches that can be done separately or in tandem.
• The simpler approach is to describe sets of resources or documents as a set
or group.
• The second approach is to rely on automated and more general-purpose or­
ganizing technologies that organize resources through computational
means. Search engines are familiar examples of computational organizing
technology, and §8.6 Computational Classification (page 427) describes other
common techniques in machine learning, clustering, and discriminant

Using “Information Theory” to Quantify Organization
We often hear news stories hyping “how much information” there is in the
information society with breathless exuberance about the creation of peta-,
exa-, whatever-bytes of content. A much more important and intellectually
deeper question than absolute size in bytes is measuring how much infor­
mation is encoded in the structure or organization of a system. For this we
can turn to “Information Theory,” a formal approach to understanding the
theoretical maximum amount of information that can be carried by a com­
munications system by using efficient coding, data compression, and error
correction. It was developed by Claude Shannon, a researcher at Bell Labo­
ratories, and first published as “a mathematical theory of communication”
in 1948. We can apply it in the discipline of organizing to compare the
amount of structure in different ways of organizing the same resources.36[IA]
Information theory quantifies the amount of organization in terms of the
number of bits, binary decisions, or rules needed to describe some structure
or pattern: the more complex or arbitrary a structure is, the more informa­
tion it takes to describe it. For example, the organization of a company with
a four-level hierarchy and a highly regular reporting structure where every­
one supervises five people, can be described quite succinctly. In contrast, a
company in which the number of direct reports at any management level is
highly variable requires many more rules to describe.
Using measures from information theory to assess the amount of organiza­
tion yields the somewhat counter-intuitive result that there is less informa­
tion in the organization of a highly structured system than in a less struc­
tured one. It might help to flip this around and describe the amount of or­
ganization in terms of the reciprocal of the information measure. A system
that is “highly organized” can be modeled or codified with relatively few
rules or organizing principles, compared to a less organized system with
many exceptions, corner cases, or one-off rules.
The “entropy” measure is often used to create predictive models of the “de­
cision tree” variety, which is an algorithm that classifies or predicts by mak­
ing a sequence of logical tests. Each test divides a collection of data into
sets with less entropy (more predictability). (See §7.5)
analysis that can be used to create a system of categories and to assign re­
sources to them.
Finally, we must acknowledge the ways in which information processing and tel­
ecommunications technologies have transformed and will continue to transform
organizing systems in every sphere of economic and intellectual activity. A cen­

2.4 How Much Is It Being Organized?

The Discipline of Organizing

tury ago, when the telegraph and telephone enabled rapid communication and
business coordination across large distances, these new technologies enabled
the creation of massive vertically integrated industrial firms. In the 1920s, the
Ford Motor Company owned coal and iron mines, rubber plantations, railroads,
and steel mills so it could manage every resource needed in automobile produc­
tion and reduce the costs and uncertainties of finding suppliers, negotiating
with them, and ensuring their contractual compliance. Adam’s Smith’s invisible
hand of the market as an organizing mechanism had been replaced by the visi­
ble hand of hierarchical management to control what Ronald Coase in 1937
termed “transaction costs” in The Nature of the Firm.
In recent decades, a new set of information and computing technologies ena­
bled by Moore’s law—unlimited computing power, effectively free bandwidth,
and the Internet—have turned Coase upside down, leading to entirely new
forms of industrial organization made possible as transaction costs plummet.
When computation and coordination costs drop dramatically, it becomes possi­
ble for small firms and networks of services (provided by people or by computa­
tional processes) to out-compete large corporations through more efficient use
of information resources and services, and through more effective information
exchange with suppliers and customers, much of it automated. Herbert Simon,
a pioneer in artificial intelligence, decision making, and human-computer inter­
action, recognized the similarities between the design of computing systems
and human organizations and developed principles and mechanisms applicable
to both.37[Bus]
Chapter 9, focuses on the representation of resource descriptions, taking a more
technological or implementation perspective. Chapter 10, discusses how the na­
ture and extent of descriptions determines the capabilities of the interactions
that locate, compare, combine, or otherwise use resources in informationintensive domains.

2.5 When Is It Being Organized?
“Because bibliographic description, when manually performed, is expen­
sive, it seems likely that the ‘pre’ organizing of information will continue
to shift incrementally toward ‘post’ organizing.”
— (Svenonius 2000, p. 194-195)

The organizing system framework recasts the traditional tradeoff between infor­
mation organization and information retrieval as the decision about when the
organization is imposed. We can contrast organization imposed on resources
“on the way in” when they are created or made part of a collection with “on the
way out” organization imposed when an interaction with resources takes place.

76

Chapter 2 — Design Decisions in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

When an author writes a document, he or she gives it some internal organiza­
tion via title, section headings, typographic conventions, page numbers, and
other mechanisms that identify its parts and relationship to each other. The
document could also have some external organization implied by the context of
its publication, such as the name of its author and publisher, its web address,
and citations or links to other documents or web pages.
Digital photos, videos, and documents are generally organized to some minimal
degree when they are created because some descriptions, notably time and lo­
cation, are assigned automatically to these types of resources by the technology
used to create them. At a minimum, these descriptions include the resource’s
creation time, storage format, and chronologically ordered, auto-assigned file­
name (IMG00001.JPG, IMG00002.JPG, etc.), but often are much more detailed.38[Com]
Digital resources created by automated processes generally exhibit a high de­
gree of organization and structure because they are generated automatically in
conformance with data or document schemas. These schemas implement the
business rules and information models for the orders, invoices, payments, and
the numerous other document types created and managed in business organiz­
ing systems.
Before a resource becomes part of a library collection, its author-created organ­
ization is often supplemented by additional information supplied by the publish­
er or other human intermediaries, such as an International Standard Book Num­
ber (ISBN) or Library of Congress Call Number (LOC-CN) or Library of Con­
gress Subject Headings (LOC-SH).
In contrast, Google and other search engines apply massive computational pow­
er to analyze the contents and associated structures (like links between web pa­
ges) to impose organization on resources that have already been published or
made available so that they can be retrieved in response to a user’s query “on
the way out.” Google makes use of existing organization within and between in­
formation resources when it can, but its unparalleled technological capabilities
and scale yield competitive advantage in imposing organization on information
that was not previously organized digitally.39[Com] One reaction to the poor quali­
ty of some computational description has been the call for libraries to put their
authoritative bibliographic resources on the open web, which would enable re­
use of reliable information about books, authors, publishers, places, and subject
classifications. This “linked data” movement is slowly gathering momen­
tum.40[Web]
Google makes almost all of its money through personalized ad placement, so
much of the selection and ranking of search results is determined “on the way
out” in the fraction of a second after the user submits a query by using informa­
tion about the user’s search history and current context. Of course, this “on the

2.5 When Is It Being Organized?

77

The Discipline of Organizing

way out” organization is only possible because of the more generic organization
that Google’s algorithms have imposed “on the way in.”
In many organizing systems the nature and extent of organization changes over
time as the resources are used. The arrangement of resources in a kitchen or
office changes incrementally as frequently used things end up in the front of the
pantry, drawer, shelf or filing cabinet or on the top of a pile of papers. Printed
books or documents acquire margin notes, underlining, turned down pages or
coffee cup stains that differentiate the most important or most frequently used
parts. Digital documents do not take on coffee cup stains, but when they are
edited, their new revision dates put them at the top of directory listings.
The scale of emergent organization of websites, photos on Flickr, blog posts,
and other resources that can be accessed and used online dwarfs the incremen­
tal evolution of individual organizing systems. This organization is clearly visible
in the pattern of links, tags, or ratings that are explicitly associated with these
resources, but search engines and advertisers also exploit the less visible organ­
ization created over time by analyzing interaction resources, the recorded infor­
mation about which resources were viewed and which links were followed.
The sort of organic or emergent change in organizing systems that takes place
over time contrasts with the planned and systematic maintenance of organizing
systems described as curation or governance, two related but distinct activities.
Curation usually refers to the methods or systems that add value to and pre­
serve resources, while the concept of governance more often emphasizes the in­
stitutions or organizations that carry out those activities. The former is most of­
ten used for libraries, museums, or archives and the latter for enterprise or
inter-enterprise contexts. (For more discussion, see §3.5.4)
The organizing systems for businesses and industries often change because of
the development of de facto or de jure standards, or because of regulations,
court decisions, or other events or mandates.
We should always consider the extent to which people or technology in an or­
ganizing system are able to adapt when new resources, data, or people enter
the picture. When and how much an organizing system can be changed depends
on the extent of architectural thinking that went into its design (see The Three
Tiers of Organizing Systems (page 47)), because it should be possible to make a
change to a component without having to rethink the system entirely.
Sometimes what prevents adaptation are physical or technological constraints
in the implementation of an organizing system, as with a desk or closet with
fixed “pigeon holes,” unmovable shelves, or with a music player with limited al­
lowable formats and/or fixed storage capacity.
Machine learning algorithms use different techniques from those of human or­
ganizers; one of the important differences is that they're designed to adapt to
78

Chapter 2 — Design Decisions in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

new inputs—which is why they’re known to be “learning.” In contrast, humans
differ in how willing we are to re-organize to accommodate a different number
or a different mix of resources. Without procedures in place to support or trig­
ger adaptation, it may be quite difficult for us to change how we think or how
we organize when our world changes, or even to realize that it has changed.

2.6 How (or by Whom) Is It Organized?
“The rise of the Internet is affecting the actual work of organizing infor­
mation by shifting it from a relatively few professional indexers and cata­
logers to the populace at large. An important question today is whether
the bibliographic universe can be organized both intelligently (that is, to
meet the traditional bibliographic objectives) and automatically.”
— (Svenonius 2000, p. 26)

In the preceding quote, Svenonius identifies three different ways for the “work
of organizing information” to be performed: by professional indexers and cata­
logers, by the populace at large, and by automated (computerized) processes.
Our notion of the organizing system is broader than her “bibliographic uni­
verse,” making it necessary to extend her taxonomy. Authors are increasingly
organizing the content they create, and it is important to distinguish users in in­
formal and formal or institutional contexts. We have also introduced the concept
of an organizing agent (§1.6) to unify organizing done by people and by comput­
er algorithms.
Professional indexers and catalogers undergo extensive training to learn the
concepts, controlled descriptive vocabularies, and standard classifications in the
particular domains in which they work. Their goal is not only to describe indi­
vidual resources, but to position them in the larger collection in which they re­
side. They can create and maintain organizing systems with consistent high
quality, but their work often requires additional research, which is costly.
The class of professional organizers also includes the employees of commercial
information services like Westlaw and LexisNexis, who add controlled and, of­
ten, proprietary metadata to legal and government documents and other news
sources. Scientists and scholars with deep expertise in a domain often function
as the professional organizers for data collections, scholarly publications and
proceedings, and other specialized information resources in their respective dis­
ciplines. The National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) claims
several thousand members who will organize your media collection, kitchen,
closet, garage or entire house or help you downsize to a smaller living
space.42[Bus]
Many of today’s content creators are unlikely to be professional organizers, but
presumably the author best understands why something was created and the

purposes for which it can be used. To the extent that authors want to help oth­
ers find a resource, they will assign descriptions or classifications that they ex­
pect will be useful to those users. But unlike professional organizers, most au­
thors are unfamiliar with controlled vocabularies and standard classifications,
and as a result their descriptions will be more subjective and less consistent.
Similarly, most of us do not hire professionals to organize the resources we col­
lect and use in our personal lives, and thus our organizing systems reflect our
individual preferences and idiosyncrasies.
Non-author users in the “populace at large” are most often creating organiza­
tion for their own benefit. These ordinary users are unlikely to use standard de­
scriptors and classifications, and the organization they impose sometimes so
closely reflects their own perspective and goals that it is not useful for others.
Fortunately most users of “Web 2.0” or “community content” applications at
least partly recognize that the organization of resources emerges from the ag­
gregated contributions of all users, which provides incentive to use less egocen­
tric descriptors and classifications. The staggering number of users and resour­
ces on the most popular applications inevitably leads to “tag convergence” sim­
ply because of the statistics of large sample sizes.
Finally, the vast size of the web and the even greater size of the “deep” or invisi­
ble web, composed of the information stores of business and proprietary infor­
mation services, makes it impossible to imagine today that it could be organized
by anything other than the massive computational power of search engine pro­
viders like Google and Microsoft. Likewise, data mining, predictive analytics,
recommendation systems, and many other application areas that involve compu­
tational modeling and classification simply could not be done any other
way.43[Web]
Nevertheless, in the earliest days of the web, significant human effort was ap­
plied to organize it. Most notable is Yahoo!, founded by Jerry Yang and David
Filo in 1994 as a directory of favorite websites. For many years the Yahoo!
homepage was the best way to find relevant websites by browsing the extensive
system of classification. Today’s Yahoo! homepage emphasizes a search engine
that makes it appear more like Google or Microsoft Bing, but the Yahoo! directo­
ry can still be found if you search for it.

2.7 Where is it being Organized?
“Bibliographic control requires fixing a document in the bibliographic
universe by its space-time coordinates.”
— (Svenonius 2000, p. 120)

Having identified the resources, reasoned about our motivations, limited the
scope and scale, and determined when and by whom the organization will occur,
we come finally to the question of where the resources are being organized.
In ordinary use, “Where” refers to a physical location. But the answer to
“where?” often depends on whether we are asking about the current location, a
past location, or an intended destination for resources that are in transit or in
process. The answer to the question “where?” can take a lot of different forms.
We can talk about an abstract space like “a library shelf” or we can talk about
“the hidden compartment in Section XY at the Library of Congress,” as depicted
in the 2004 movie “National Treasure.” We can answer “where?” with a descrip­
tion of a set of environmental conditions that best suit a class of wildlife, or a
tire, or a sleeping bag. We can answer “where?” with “Renaissance Europe” or
“Colonial Williamsburg.” “Where?” can be a place in a mental construct, or even
a place in an imagined location.
In the architectural design of an organizing system, its physical location is usu­
ally not a primary concern. In most organizing systems, the matter of where the
organizing system and the resources are located can be abstracted away. So, in
practice, resource location often is not as important as the other questions here.
Physical constraints of the storage location should generally be relegated to an
implementation concern rather than an architectural one. The construction of a
special display structure for a valuable resource is not an independent design
dimension; it is just the implementation of the user interface. (See §6.7 The Im­
plementation Perspective (page 308))
Physical resources are often stored where it is convenient and efficient to do so,
whether in ordinary warehouses, offices, storerooms, shelves, cabinets, and
closets. It can be necessary to adapt an organizing system to characteristics of
its physical environment, but this could undermine architectural thinking and
make it harder to maintain the organization over time, as the collection evolves
in scope and scale. (See §3.3.1 Organizing Physical Resources (page 100))
Digital resources, on the other hand, are increasingly organized and stored “in
the cloud” and their actual locations are invisible, indeterminate, and generally
irrelevant, except in situations where the servers and the information they hold
may be subject to laws or practices of their physical location. For example, a
controversy arose in Canada in 2013 when researchers discovered that Internet
2.7 Where is it being Organized?

81

The Discipline of Organizing

service providers were, for various technical and business reasons, routinely
routing trans-Canada web traffic through the United States. Because Canada
has no jurisdiction over data traveling through cables and servers in another
country, there was considerable outcry among Canadians who were concerned
that their personal information was being subjected to the privacy laws and
practices of another country without their knowledge or consent.
Sometimes location functions as an organizing principle in its own right, which
in practice essentially collapses many of these architectural distinctions. This is
frequently the case in our personal organizing systems, where we may exploit
the innate human capability for spatial memory by always putting specific
things like keys, eyeglasses, and cell phones in the same place, which makes
them easy to find. But we can also see this happening in systems as complex
and varied as: real estate information systems; wayfinding systems, such as
road signage or mile markers; standardized international customs forms with
position-specific data fields; geographic information systems; air, ground, sea,
and space traffic control systems; and historic landmark preservation.
In §3.3.2 Organizing Places (page 103) we consider the organization of the land,
built environments, and wayfinding systems. §6.5 The Structural Perspective
(page 294) discusses the structural perspective on resource relationships, and
in some systems, it may be very significant where resources are located in rela­
tion to one another. In The Barnes Collection (page 546), for example, works of
art are physically grouped to enunciate common characteristics. Conversely,
zoos do not mix the kangaroos with the wild dogs, and the military does not mix
the ingredients for chemical weapons (at least, not until they plan to use them).
There are also circumstances where resources can only exist in (or are particu­
larly suited to) particular environments, such as the conditions required to grow
wine grapes or mushrooms, or store spent nuclear fuel. UPS advises companies
on where to put their warehouses and shipment centers. These are more sub­
stantial than questions of presentation, but it is debatable whether it falls under
the storage or logic tier (you could have the principle of “keep the mushrooms
somewhere moist” while not dictating where particularly).
Sometimes the location of an organizing system seems particularly salient, as in
the design of cities where the street plan can be essential for orientation and
navigation, and is embodied in zoning, voting, and other explicit organization,
as well as in informal organization like neighborhood identity. But even here, it
is really the people who live in the city who are being organized and whose in­
teractions with the city and with each other are being encouraged or discour­
aged, not the physical location on which they live.
Indeed, in designing an organizing system you will often find that questions
about location tumble naturally out of the other five design dimensions. For in­
stance, questions about “when,” “what,” and “where” are often inseparable,

82

Chapter 2 — Design Decisions in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

particularly when an organizing system is subject to outside regulations, which
tend to have geographical jurisdictions. “Where” is also commonly bound up
with “who” and “why,” when locational challenges or opportunities faced by a
system's creators or users necessitate special design consideration. (See
§4.5.2 Effectivity (page 200))
Location can be critically important to an organizing system—too important, in
fact, to be considered alone. The question of “where?” is best considered in con­
text of the other five design dimensions as a whole; a narrow focus on where the
resources are being organized too often privileges past convention over archi­
tectural thinking and perpetuates legacy issues and poorly organized systems.

2.8 Key Points in Chapter Two
• A dimensional perspective makes it easier to translate between categoryand discipline-specific vocabularies so that people from different disciplines
can have mutually intelligible discussions about their organizing activities.
(See §2.1 Introduction (page 61))
• In different situations, the same “thing” can be treated as a unique item, one
of many equivalent members of a broad category, or a component of an item
rather than as an item on its own.
(See §2.2 What Is Being Organized? (page 64))
• A single physical resource can only be in one place at a time, and interac­
tions with it are constrained by its size, location, and other properties. In
contrast, digital copies and surrogates can exist in many places at once and
enable searching, sorting, and other interactions with an efficiency and
scale impossible for tangible things.
(See §2.2 What Is Being Organized? (page 64))
• When the resources being organized consist of information content, deciding
on the unit of organization is challenging because it might be necessary to
look beyond physical properties and consider conceptual or intellectual
equivalence.
(See §2.2 What Is Being Organized? (page 64))
• Libraries, museums, and archives are often classified as memory institutions
to emphasize their primary emphasis on resource preservation.
(See §2.3 Why Is It Being Organized? (page 66))
• Businesses and governmental agencies are usually required by law to keep
records of financial transactions, decision-making, personnel matters, and
other information essential to business continuity, compliance with regula­
tions and legal procedures, and transparency.

2.8 Key Points in Chapter Two

The Discipline of Organizing

(See §2.3 Why Is It Being Organized? (page 66))
• If a system can turn its interaction traces into interaction resources, addi­
tional value can be created by analyzing these resources to enhance the in­
teractions, to suggest new ones, or make predictions about how individual
users or groups of them will behave.
(See §2.3 Why Is It Being Organized? (page 66))
• Resources are always organized in ways that are designed to allocate value
for some people (e.g., the owners of the resources, or the most frequent
users of them) and not for others.
(See §2.3 Why Is It Being Organized? (page 66))
• Subtle differences in resource arrangement, the number and framing of
choices, and default values can have substantial effects on the decisions peo­
ple make.
(See §2.3 Why Is It Being Organized? (page 66))
• Different merchants or firms might make different decisions about the ex­
tent or granularity of description when they assign SKUs because of differ­
ences in suppliers, targeted customers, or other business strategies.
(See §2.4 How Much Is It Being Organized? (page 70))
• A detailed description produced by sensors or computers can seem more ac­
curate or authoritative than a simpler one created by a human observer,
even if the latter would be more useful for the intended purposes. Detailed
transaction data can be used to violate privacy and civil rights.
(See §2.4 How Much Is It Being Organized? (page 70))
• Organizing more resources requires more descriptions to distinguish any
particular resource from the rest, and more constraining organizing princi­
ples. Similar resources need to be grouped or classified to emphasize the
most important distinctions among the complete set of resources in the col­
lection.
(See §2.4 How Much Is It Being Organized? (page 70))
• We can contrast organization imposed on resources “on the way in” when
they are created or made part of a collection with “on the way out” organiza­
tion imposed when an interaction with resources takes place.
(See §2.5 When Is It Being Organized? (page 76))
• Digital resources created by automated processes generally exhibit a high
degree of organization and structure because they are generated automati­
cally in conformance with data or document schemas.

For example, many people manage their digital photos with Flickr, their
home libraries with Library Thing, and their preferences for dining and shop­
ping with Yelp. It is possible to use these “tagging” sites solely in support of in­
dividual goals, as tags like “my family,” “to read,” or “buy this” clearly demon­
strate. But maintaining a personal organizing system with these web applica­
tions potentially augments the individual’s purpose with social goals like con­
veying information to others, developing a community, or promoting a reputa­
tion. Furthermore, because these community or collaborative applications ag­
gregate and share the tags applied by individuals, they shape the individual or­
ganizing systems embedded within them when they suggest the most frequent
tags for a particular resource.

3.1 Introduction
There are four activities that occur naturally in every organizing system; how
explicit they are depend on the scope, the breadth or variety of the resources,
and the scale, the number of resources that the organizing system encompass­
es. Consider the routine, everyday task of managing your wardrobe. When you
organize your clothes closet, you are unlikely to write a formal selection policy
that specifies what things go in the closet. You do not consciously itemize and
prioritize the ways you expect to search for and locate things, and you are un­
likely to consider explicitly the organizing principles that you use to arrange
them. From time to time you will put things back in order and discard things
you no longer wear, but you probably will not schedule this as a regular activity
on your calendar.

The Discipline of Organizing

Your clothes closet is an organizing system; defined as “an intentionally ar­
ranged collection of resources and the interactions they support.” As such, it ex­
poses these four highly interrelated and iterative activities:
Selecting
Determining the scope of the organizing system by specifying which resour­
ces should be included. (Should I hang up my sweaters in the clothes closet
or put them in a dresser drawer in the bedroom?)
Organizing
Specifying the principles or rules that will be followed to arrange the resour­
ces. (Should I sort my shirts by color, sleeve type, or season?)
Designing resource-based interactions
Designing and implementing the actions, functions or services that make use
of the resources. (Do I need storage places for clothes to be laundered?
Should I have separate baskets for white and colors? Dry cleaning?)
Maintaining
Managing and adapting the resources and the organization imposed on them
as needed to support the interactions. (When is it time to straighten up the
closet? What about mending? Should I toss out clothes based on wear and
tear, how long I have owned them, or whether I am tired of them? What
about excess hangers?)
These activities are not entirely separable or sequential, and they can be infor­
mal for your clothes closet because its scope and scale are limited. In institu­
tional organizing systems the activities and the inter-dependencies and itera­
tions among them are more carefully managed and often highly formal.
For example, a data warehouse combines data from different sources like or­
ders, sales, customers, inventory, and finance. Business analysts explore combi­
nations and subsets of the data to find important patterns and relationships. The
most important questions in the design and operation of the data warehouse
can be arranged using the same activities as the clothes closet.
Selecting
Which data sources should be included? How is their quality assessed? How
much of the data is sampled? How are queries composed?
Organizing
Which data formats and schemas will enable effective processing? Are nee­
ded transformations made at load time or query time?
Designing resource-based interactions
What are the most important and frequent queries that need to be preconfigured?

ties in all organizing systems, framing the depiction of the organizing and inter­
action design activities shown in Figure 1.1, An Organizing System. with the se­
lection and maintenance activities that necessarily precede and follow them.

Figure 3.1. Four Activities in all Organizing Systems.

Four activities take place in all organizing systems: selection of resources for a
collection; intentional organization of the resources; design and implementation
of interactions with individual resources or with the collection, and; mainte­
nance of the resources and the interactions over time.

3.1 Introduction

89

The Discipline of Organizing

These activities are deeply ingrained in academic curricula and professional
practices, with domain-specific terms for their methods and results. Libraries
and museums usually make their selection principles explicit in collection devel­
opment policies. Adding a resource to a library collection is called acquisition,
but adding to a museum collection is called accessioning. Documenting the con­
tents of library and museum collections to organize them is called cataloging.
Circulation is a central interaction in libraries, but because museum resources
do not circulate the primary interactions for museum users are viewing or visit­
ing the collection. Maintenance activities are usually described as preservation
or curation.
In business information systems, selection of resources can involve data genera­
tion, capture, sampling, or extraction. Adding resources could involve loading,
integration, or insertion. Schema development and data transformation are im­
portant organizing activities. Supported interactions could include querying, re­
porting, analysis, or visualization. Maintenance activities are often described as
deletion, purging, data cleansing, governance, or compliance.

What about “Creating” Resources?
Our definition of organizing system as an intentionally arranged collection
of resources might seem to imply that resources must exist before they are
organized. This is often the case when we organize physical resources be­
cause the need for principled organization only arises when the collection
gets too big for us to see everything in the collection at once. Similarly,
many data analytics projects begin by bringing together data collected by
others.
However, organizing systems for digital resources are often put in place as
a prerequisite for creating them. This is always necessary when the resour­
ces are created by automated processes or data entry in business systems,
and usually the case with professional writers in a technical publications
context. We can think of database or document schemas (at the implementa­
tion tier) or data entry forms or word processor templates (in the user inter­
face tier) as embodiments of the organizing principles in the data records or
documents that are then created in conformance with them.
Domain-specific methods and vocabularies evolve over time to capture the com­
plex and distinctive sets of experiences and practices of their respective disci­
plines. We can identify correspondences and overlapping meanings, but they
are not synonyms or substitutes for each other. We propose more general terms
like selection and maintenance, not as lowest common denominator replace­
ments for these more specialized ones, but to facilitate communication and co­
operation across the numerous disciplines that are concerned with organizing.

It might sound odd to describe the animals in a zoo as resources, to think of
viewing a painting in a museum as an interaction, or to say that destroying in­
formation to comply with privacy regulations is maintenance. Taking a broader
perspective on the activities in organizing systems so that we can identify best
practices and patterns enables people with different backgrounds and working
in different domains to understand and learn from each other.
Part of what a database administrator can learn from a museum curator follows
from the rich associations the curator has accumulated around the concept of
curation that are not available around the more general concept of mainte­
nance. Without the shared concept of maintenance to bridge their disciplines,
this learning could not take place.

Navigating this chapter
In §1.3 The Concept of “Resource” (page 35) and §2.2 What Is Being
Organized? (page 64) we briefly discussed the fundamental concept
of a resource. In this chapter, we describe the four primary activities
with resources, using examples from many different kinds of organiz­
ing systems.

We emphasize the activities of organizing and of designing resourcebased interactions that make use of the organization imposed on the
resources. We discuss selection and maintenance to create the con­
text for the organizing activities and to highlight the interdependen­
cies of organizing and these other activities.

3.1 Introduction

91

The Discipline of Organizing

3.2 Selecting Resources
When we talk about organizing systems, we often do so in terms of the contents
of their collections. This implies that the most fundamental decision for an or­
ganizing system is determining its resource domain, the group or type of resour­
ces that are being organized. This decision is usually a constraint, not a choice;
we acquire or encounter some resources that we need to interact with over
time, and we need to organize them so we can do that effectively.
Selecting is the process by which resources are identified, evaluated, and then
added to a collection in an organizing system. Selection is first shaped by the
domain and then by the scope of the organizing system, which can be analyzed
through six interrelated aspects:
1. the number and nature of users
2. the time span or lifetime over which the organizing system is expected to op­
erate
3. the size of the collection
4. the expected changes to the collection
5. the physical or technological environment in which the organizing system is
situated or implemented
6. the relationship of the organizing system to other ones that overlap with it in
domain or scope.
(In Chapter 11, The Organizing System Roadmap, we discuss these six aspects in
more detail.)

3.2.1 Selection Criteria
Selection must be an intentional process because, by definition, an organizing
system contains resources whose selection and arrangement was determined by
human or computational agents, not by natural processes. And given the broad
definition of resource as “anything of value that can support goal-oriented activ­
ity” it follows that resources should be selected by an implicit or explicit assess­
ment to determine whether they can be used to achieve those goals. So even
though particular selection methods and criteria vary across resource domains,
their common purpose is to determine how well the resource satisfies the speci­
fications for the properties or capabilities that enable a person or nonhuman
agent to perform the intended activities. “Fitness for use” is a common and con­
cise way to summarize this idea, and while it highlights the need to have activi­
ties in mind before resources are selected to enable them, it also explains why
precise selection criteria are harder to define for organizing systems that have

92

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

diverse sets of stakeholders or users with different goals, like those in public li­
braries.
Many resources are evaluated and selected one-at-a-time. This makes it impossi­
ble to specify in advance every property or criterion that might be considered in
making a selection decision, especially for unique or rare resources like those
being considered by a museum or private collector. In general, when resources
are treated as instances, organizing activities typically occur after selection
takes place, as in the closet organizing system with which we began this chap­
ter.
When the resources being considered for a collection are more homogeneous
and predictable, it is possible to treat them as a class or set, which enables se­
lection criteria and organizing principles to be specified in advance. This makes
selection and organizing into concurrent activities. This would be the case in
the data warehouse organizing system, the other example at the beginning of
this chapter, because each data source can be described by a schema whose
structure is reflected in the organization of the data warehouse. Put another
way, as long as subsequent datasets from a specific source do not differ in struc­
ture, only in temporal attributes like their creation or acquisition dates, the or­
ganization imposed on the initial dataset can be replicated for each subsequent
one.
Well-run companies and organizations in every industry are highly systematic in
selecting the resources that must be managed and the information needed to
manage them. “Selecting the right resource for the job” is a clichéd way of say­
ing this, but this slogan nonetheless applies broadly to raw materials, functional
equipment, information resources and datasets, and to people, who are often
called “human resources” in corporate-speak.
For some types of resources, the specifications that guide selection can be pre­
cise and measurable. Precise specifications are especially important when an
organizing system will contain or make use of all resources of a particular type,
or if all the resources produced from a particular source become part of the or­
ganizing system on some regular schedule. Selection specifications can also be
shaped by laws, regulations or policies that require or prohibit the collection of
certain kinds of objects or types of information.44[Law]
For example, when a manufacturer of physical goods selects the materials or
components that are transformed into its products, it carefully evaluates the
candidate resources and their suppliers before making them part of its supply
chain. The manufacturer would test the resources against required values of
measurable characteristics like chemical purity, strength, capacity, and reliabili­
ty. A business looking for transactional or demographic data to guide a business
expansion strategy would specify different measurable characteristics; data files
must be valid with respect to a schema, must contain no duplicates or personal­

ly identifiable information, and must be less than one month old when they are
delivered. Similarly, employee selection has become highly data-intensive; em­
ployers hire people after assessing the match between their competencies and
capabilities (expressed verbally or in a resume, or demonstrated in some qualifi­
cation test) and what is needed to do the required activities.45[DS]
Selection is an essential activity in creating organizing systems whose purpose
is to combine separate web services or resources to create a composite service
or application according to the business design philosophy of Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA).46[Com] When an information-intensive enterprise or applica­
tion combines its internal services with ones provided by others via Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs), the resources are selected to create a combined
collection of services according to the “core competency” principle: resources
are selected and combined to exploit the first party’s internal capabilities and
those of its service partners better than any other combination of services
could. For example, instead of writing millions of lines of code and collecting de­
tailed maps to build an interactive map in an application, you can get access to
the Google Maps organizing system with just a few lines of code.47[Bus] (See the
sidebar, Selection of Web-based Resources (page 94))

Selection of Web-based Resources
The nature and scale of the web changes how we collect resources and fun­
damentally challenges how we think of resources in the first place. Webbased resources cannot be selected for a collection by consulting a central­
ized authoritative directory, catalog, or index because one does not exist.
ProgrammableWeb and other directories organize thousands of webaccessible APIs, and the dominant resource-organizing firms Amazon, Sales­
force, Facebook, and Twitter offer hundreds of APIs to access massive
amounts of information about products, people, and posts, but APIs enable
access to only a fraction of the web’s content. And although your favorite
web search engine consults an index or directory of web resources when
you enter a search query, you do not know where that index or directory
came from or how it was assembled.49[Web]
However, the web has universal scope and global reach, making most of the
web irrelevant to most people most of the time. Researchers have attacked
this problem by treating the web as a combination of a very large number of
topic-based or domain-specific collections of resources, and then developing
techniques for extracting these collections as digital libraries targeted for
particular users and uses.50[Web]
Scientific and business data are ideally selected after assessments of their quali­
ty and their relevance to answering specific questions. But this is easy to say
and hard to do. It is essential to assess the quality of individual data items to

find data entry problems such as misspellings and duplicate records, or data
values that are illegal, statistical outliers, or otherwise suspicious. It is also es­
sential to assess the quality of data as a collection to determine if there are
problems in what data was collected, by whom or how it was collected and man­
aged, the format and precision in which it is stored, whether the schema gov­
erning each instance is rigorous enough, and whether the collection is com­
plete. In addition, copyright, licensing, consumer protection laws, competitive
considerations, or simply the lack of incentives to share resources make it diffi­
cult to obtain the best or most appropriate resources.51[DS] (See the sidebar, As­
sessing and Addressing Data Quality (page 97))
In some domains, the nature of the resources or the goals they are intended to
satisfy imply selection criteria that are inherently less quantifiable and more
subjective. This is easy to see in personal collections, where selection criteria
can be unconventional, idiosyncratic, or otherwise biased by the subjective per­
spective and experience of the collector. Most of the clothes and shoes you own
have a reason for being in your closet, but could anyone else explain the con­
tents of your closet and its organizing system, and why you bought that crazylooking dress or shirt?
Even when selection criteria can be measured and evaluated in isolation, they
are often incompatible or difficult to satisfy in combination. It would be desira­
ble for data to be timely, accurate, complete, and consistent, but these criteria
trade off against one other, and any prioritization that values one criterion over
another is somewhat subjective. In addition, explicitly subjective perceptions of
resource quality are hard to ignore; people are inclined to choose resources that
come in attractive packages or that are sold and supported by attractive and
friendly people.
Many of the examples in this section have involved selection principles whose
purpose was to create a collection of desirable, rare, skilled, or otherwise dis­
tinctive resources. After all, no one would visit a museum whose artifacts were
ordinary, and no one would watch a sports team made up of randomly chosen
athletes because it could never win. However, choosing resources by randomly
sampling from a large population is essential if your goal is to make inferences
about it without having to study all its instances. Sampling is especially necessa­
ry with very large populations when timely decisions are required. A good sam­
ple for statistical purposes is one in which the selected resources are not differ­
ent in any important way from the ones that were not selected.
Sampling is also important when large numbers of resources need to be selec­
ted to satisfy functional requirements. A manufacturer cannot test every part ar­
riving at the factory, but might randomly test some of them from different ship­
ments to ensure that parts satisfy their acceptance criteria.

3.2 Selecting Resources

The Discipline of Organizing

3.2.2 Looking “Upstream” and “Downstream” to Select Resources
As we have seen, selection principles and activities differ across resource do­
mains, and there is another important difference in selection that considers re­
sources from the perspective of their history or the future.
In §3.2.1 we discussed the activity of selecting resources by assessing their con­
formance with specifications for required properties or capabilities. However, if
you can determine where the resources come from, you can make better selec­
tion decisions by evaluating the people, processes, and organizing systems that
create them. Using the analogy of a river, we can follow a resource “upstream”
from us until we find the “headwaters.” Physical resources might have their
headwaters in a factory, farm, or artist’s studio. Digital resources might have
headwaters in a government agency, a scientist’s laboratory, or a web-based
commerce site.
When interaction resources (§1.9) are incorporated into the organizing system
that creates them, as when records of a person’s choices and behaviors are
used to personalize subsequent information, the headwaters are obviously easy
to find. However, even though finding the headwaters where resources come
from is often not easy and sometimes not possible, that is where you are most
likely to find the people best able to answer the questions, described in Chap­
ter 2, that define any organizing system. The resource creators or producers
will know the assumptions and tradeoffs they made that influence whether the
resources will satisfy your requirements, and you can assess what they (or their
documents that describe the resources) tell you and the credibility they have in
telling it. You should also try to evaluate the processes or algorithms that pro­
duce the resources, and then decide if they are capable of yielding resources of
acceptable quality.
The best outcome is to find a credible supplier of good quality resources. How­
ever, if an otherwise desirable supplier does not currently produce resources of
sufficient quality, it is worth trying to improve the quality by changing the proc­
ess using instruction or incentives. Advocates for open government have suc­
ceeded in getting numerous US government entities to publish data for free in
machine-readable formats, but it was partly as a result of somewhat subversive
demonstration projects and shaming that the government finally created da­
ta.gov in 2009. A clear lesson from the “quality movement” and statistical proc­
ess control is that interventions that fix quality problems at their source are al­
most always a better investment than repeated work to fix problems that were
preventable (see endnote297 [Bus]). But if you cannot find the headwaters or you
are not able to address quality problems at their source, you can sometimes
transform the resources to give them the characteristics or quality they
need.53[DS] (See the sidebar, Assessing and Addressing Data Quality (page 97),
and §10.3.2 Transforming Resources for Interactions (page 500).)

96

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

Assessing and Addressing Data Quality
If an organizing system uses data acquired from some external source, it is
essential to assess its quality as an “intake” process. Ideally, the data comes
with a schema that explicitly specifies what is expected, including legal
structures, data types, and values (See §9.2 Structuring Descriptions (page
439)). This intake process runs tests that find problems and then runs pro­
cesses to fix the problems.
There are a great many techniques for finding problems in numeric and
string data. Some problems like missing data, duplicate records, spelling
mistakes, and extreme or “outlier” values are easy to detect. A credit card
charge for $10,000,000 is obviously a bad piece of data in a college stu­
dent’s account. Detecting anomalous and duplicate data is especially impor­
tant because including them can produce misleading statistics and predic­
tions, as well as creating the nuisance for consumers of receiving multiple
copies of product catalogs, each with a different misspelling in a name or
address.
Sometimes a dataset is valid with respect to its own specification but be­
comes problematical when it is combined with another dataset that has a
different specification. Entities in the two datasets might not be described
using the same units at the same point in time. So instead of analyzing and
repairing resource instances, data cleaning must now be applied to every
resource in a dataset, as when every “Zip Code” in a United States mailing
directory is given the more universal “Postal Code” label, or when datasets
using DD/MM/YY and MM/DD/YY formats for dates are combined.
Other data quality problems are harder to detect because they are contextu­
al; a data value might be valid in some contexts but the same value might be
invalid in others. For example, if you live in San Francisco and your credit
card is used for transactions in Barcelona or Berlin, it could be fraud, or
maybe you are on vacation. Similarly, high or low ratings for business estab­
lishments on sites like Yelp might be appropriate responses to excellent or
poor service, but might also reflect “pay for rating” manipulation in the for­
mer case, and efforts by competitors to undermine rival businesses in the
latter.54[Com]
When you cannot obtain resources directly from their source, even if you have
confidence in their quality at that point, it is important to analyze any evidence
or records of their use or interactions as they flow downstream. (See §4.5) Phys­
ical resources are often associated with printed or digital documents that make
claims about their origin and authenticity, and often have bar codes, RFID tags,
or other technological mechanisms that enable them to be tracked from their
headwaters to the places where they are used. Tracking is very important for

data resources because they can often be added to, derived from, or otherwise
changed without leaving visible traces. Just as the water from melted mountain
snow becomes less pure as its flows downstream, a data resource can become
“dirty” or “noisy” over time, reducing its quality from the perspective of another
person or computational agent further downstream. Data often gets dirty when
it is combined with other datasets that contain duplicate or seemingly-duplicate
information. Data can also become dirty when the hardware or software that
stores it changes. Subtle differences in representation formats, transaction
management, enforcement of integrity constraints, and calculations of derived
values can change the original data.
In addition, a data resource can become inaccurate or obsolete simply because
the world that the data describes has changed with the passage of time. People
move, change jobs, get married or divorced, or die. Likewise, companies move,
merge, get spun off, or go out of business. A poll taken a year before an election
is often not a good predictor of the ultimate winner.55[Com]
Other selection processes look “downstream” to select resources on the basis of
predicted rather than current properties, capability, or suitability. Sports teams
often sign promising athletes for their minor league teams, and businesses hire
interns, train their employees, and run executive development programs to pre­
pare promising low-level managers for executive roles. Businesses sometimes
conduct experiments with variable product offers and pricing to collect data
they will need in the future to power predictive models that will repay the in­
vestment in data acquisition many times over.

3.3 Organizing Resources
Organizing systems arrange resources according to many different principles.
In libraries, museums, businesses, government agencies and other long-lived in­
stitutions, organizing principles are typically documented as cataloging rules,
information management policies, or other explicit and systematic procedures
so that different people can apply them consistently over time. In contrast, the
principles for arranging resources in personal or small-scale organizing systems
are usually informal and often inconsistent or conflicting.
For most types of resources, any number of principles could be used as the ba­
sis for their organization depending on the answers to the “why?” (§2.3), “how
much?” (§2.4), and “how?” (§2.6) questions posed in Chapter 2.
A simple principle for organizing resources is colocation —putting all the re­
sources in the same location: in the same container, on the same shelf, or in the
same email in-box. However, most organizing systems use principles that are
based on specific resource properties or properties derived from the collection
as a whole. What properties are significant and how to think about them

98

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

depends on the number of resources being
organized, the purposes for which they are
being organized, and on the experiences
and implicit or explicit biases of the inten­
ded users of the organizing system. The im­
plementation of the organizing system also
shapes the need for, and the nature of, the
resource properties.57[DS]
Many resource collections acquire resources
one at a time or in sets of related resources
that can initially be treated the same way.
Therefore, it is natural to arrange resources
based on properties that can be assessed
and interpreted when the resource becomes
part of the collection.

Property
In this book we use property
in a generic and ordinary
sense as a synonym for fea­
ture
or
“characteristic.”
Many cognitive and computer
scientists are more precise in
defining these terms and re­
serve property for binary
predicates (e.g., something is
red or not, round or not). If
multiple values are possible,
the property is called an at­
tribute, “dimension,” or “var­
iable.” Feature is used in da­
ta science and machine
learning contexts for both
“raw” or observable variables
and “latent” ones, extracted
or constructed from the origi­
nal set.56[CogSci]

“Subject matter” organization involves the
use of a classification system that provides
categories and descriptive terms for indicat­
ing what a resource is about. Because they
use aboutness properties that are not direct­
ly perceived, methods for assigning subject
classifications are intellectually-intensive
and in many cases require rigorous training to be performed consistently and
appropriately. Nevertheless, the cost and time required for this human effort
motivates the use of computational techniques for organizing resources.
As computing power steadily increases, the bias toward computational organiza­
tion gets even stronger. However, an important concern arises when computa­
tional methods for organizing resources use so-called “black box” methods that
create resource descriptions and organizing principles that are not inspectable
or interpretable by people. In some applications more efficient information re­
trieval or question answering, more accurate predictions, or more personalized
recommendations justify making the tradeoff. But comprehensibility is critical in
many medical, military, financial, or scientific applications, where trusting a pre­
diction can have life or death implications or cause substantial time or money to
be spent.59[DS]

3.3 Organizing Resources

The Discipline of Organizing

3.3.1 Organizing Physical Resources
When the resources being arranged are physical or tangible things—such as
books, paintings, animals, or cooking pots—any resource can be in only one
place at a time in libraries, museums, zoos, or kitchens. Similarly, when organiz­
ing involves recording information in a physical medium—carving in stone, im­
printing in clay, applying ink to paper by hand or with a printing press—how
this information can be organized is subject to the intrinsic properties and con­
straints of physical things.
The inescapable tangibility of physical resources means that their organizing
systems are often strongly influenced by the material or medium in which the
resources are presented or represented. For example, museums generally col­
lect original artifacts and their collections are commonly organized according to
the type of thing being collected. There are art museums, sculpture museums,
craft museums, toy museums, science museums, and so on.
Similarly, because they have different material manifestations, we usually or­
ganize our printed books in a different location than our record albums, which
might be near but remain separate from our CDs and DVDs. This is partly be­
cause the storage environments for physical resources (shelves, cabinets, clos­
ets, and so on) have co-evolved with the physical resources they store.

3.3.1.1 Organizing with Properties of Physical Resources
Physical resources are often organized according to intrinsic physical properties
like their size, color, or shape, because the human visual system automatically
pays a lot of attention to them.
This inescapable aspect of visual perception was first formalized by German
psychologists starting a century ago as the Gestalt principles (see the sidebar,
Gestalt Principles (page 102)). Likewise, because people have limited attentional
capacity, we ignore a lot of the ongoing complexity of visual (and auditory) stim­
ulation, making us perceive our sensory world as simpler than it really is. Taken
together, these two ideas explain why we automatically or “pre-attentively” or­
ganize separate things we see as groups or patterns based on their proximity
and similarity. They also explain why arranging physical resources using these
quickly perceived attributes can seem more aesthetic or satisfying than organiz­
ing them using properties that take more time to understand. Look at the cover
of this book; the most organized arrangement of the colors and shapes just
jumps out at you more than the others.
Physical resources are also commonly organized using intrinsically associated
properties such as the place and time they were created or discovered. The
shirts in your clothes closet might be arranged by color, by fabric, or style. We

Organizing People into Businesses
How people are organized into businesses is the essence of the discipline of
management, and different aspects are taught in industrial organization and
behavior, operations, entrepreneurship, and other courses. Organizing peo­
ple in a business is often called “human resource management,” and many
of the principles for organizing physical resources and information resour­
ces apply to organizing people.
In addition, economics, strategy, and business culture are important consid­
erations. There are a huge number of ways to organize people that differ in
the extent of hierarchical structure, the flow of information up and down the
hierarchy, the span of control for managers, and the discretion people have
to deviate or innovate with respect to the work they have been assigned to
do. For example, we can contrast law firms with a hierarchy of partners, as­
sociates, and paralegals with the self-management “holacracy” that compa­
nies like Zappos have experimented with, in which authority and decisionmaking are highly distributed among the employees.
Regardless of how the firm is organized, we can analyze it using economist
Ronald Coase's idea of “transaction costs,” which a business incurs in
searching for and negotiating with suppliers, business partners, and cus­
tomers, and in particular we can consider how new information and comput­
ing technologies reduce these costs to make the firm more efficient while
remaining flexible.61[Bus]
can view dress shirts, T-shirts, Hawaiian shirts and other styles as configura­
tions of shirt properties that are so frequent and familiar that they have become
linguistic and cultural categories. Other people might think about these same
properties or categories differently, using a greater or lesser number of colors
or ordering them differently, sorting the shirts by style first and then by color, or
vice versa.
In addition to, or instead of, physical properties of your shirts, you might employ
behavioral or usage-based properties to arrange them. You might separate your
party and Hawaiian shirts from those you wear to the office. You might put the
shirts you wear most often in the front of the closet so they are easy to locate.
Unlike intrinsic properties of resources, which do not change, behavioral or
usage-based properties are dynamic. You might move to Hawaii, where you can
wear Hawaiian shirts to the office, or you could get tired of what were once
your favorite shirts and stop wearing them as often as you used to.
Some arrangements of physical resources are constrained or precluded by re­
source properties that might cause problems for other resources or for their
users. Hazardous or flammable materials should not be stored where they might

Gestalt Principles
Psychologists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Kohler, and Kurt Koffka proposed
several principles—proximity, similarity, continuity, connection, enclosure,
and closure—that explain how our visual system imposes order on what it
sees. There are always multiple interpretations of the sensory stimuli gath­
ered by our visual system, but the mind imposes the simplest ones: things
near each other are grouped, complex shapes are viewed as simple shapes
that are overlapping, missing information needed to see separate visual pat­
terns as continuous or whole is filled in, and ambiguous figure-ground illu­
sions are given one interpretation at a time.
Koffka's pithy way of explaining the core idea of all the principles was that
“The whole is other than the sum of the parts,” which has been distorted
over time to the cliché that “the whole is more than the sum of the
parts.”62[CogSci]
Designers of graphics and information visualizations rely on Gestalt rules
because the automatic interpretations created by the human visual system
enable their designs to be understood more quickly. This of course implies
that designs that violate the Gestalt rules will be harder to understand.
Camouflage—the use of disruptive coloration, colors and patterns that re­
semble backgrounds, countershading, shadow elimination, and similar tech­
niques that make it difficult for the visual system to detect objects and
edges—proves the power of Gestalt processing.63[IA]
spill or ignite; lions and antelopes should not share the same zoo habitat or the
former will eat the latter; adult books and movies should not be kept in a library
where children might accidentally find them; and people who are confrontation­
al, passive aggressive, or arrogant do not make good team members when
tough decisions need to be made. For almost any resource, it seems possible to
imagine a combination with another resource that might have unfortunate con­
sequences. We have no shortage of professional certifications, building codes,
MPAA movie ratings, and other types of laws and regulations designed to keep
us safe from potentially dangerous resources.

3.3.1.2 Organizing with Descriptions of Physical Resources
To overcome the inherent constraints with organizing physical resources, organ­
izing systems often use additional physical resources that describe the primary
physical ones, with the library card catalog being the classic example. A specific
physical resource might be in a particular place, but multiple description re­
sources for it can be in many different places at the same time.

ditional layer of abstraction created en­
ables additional organizing possibilities
that can ignore physical properties of resources and many of the details about
how they are stored.
In organizing systems that use additional resources to identify or describe pri­
mary ones, “adding to a collection” is a logical act that need not require any ac­
tual movement, copying, or reorganization of the primary resources. This virtual
addition allows the same resources to be part of many collections at the same
time; the same book can be listed in many bibliographies, the same web page
can be in many lists of web bookmarks and have incoming links from many dif­
ferent pages, and a publisher’s digital article repository can be licensed to any
number of libraries.

3.3.2 Organizing Places
Places are physical resources, but unlike the previous two subsections where
we treat the environment as given (the library or museum building, the card
catalog or bookshelf) and discuss how we organize resources like books in that
environment, we can take an alternative perspective and discuss how we design
that physical environment. These environments could be any of the following:

3.3 Organizing Resources

103

The Discipline of Organizing

• The land itself, as when we lay out city plans when organizing how people
live together and interact in cities.
• A “built environment,” a human-made space, particular building, or a set of
connected spaces and buildings. A built environment could be a museum,
airport, hospital, casino, department store, farm, road system, or any kind of
building or space where resources are arranged and people interact with
them.
• The orientation and navigation aids that enable users to understand and in­
teract in built environments. These are resource descriptions that support
the interaction requirements of the users.
These are not entirely separable contexts, but they are easier to discuss as if
they are considered as such.

3.3.2.1 Organizing the Land
Cities naturally emerge in places that can support life and commerce. Almost all
major cities are built on coasts or rivers because water provides sustenance,
transportation and commercial links, and power to enable industry. Many very
old cities have crowded and convoluted street plans that do not seem intention­
ally organized, but grid plans in cities also have a very long history. Cities in the
Middle East were laid out in rough grids as far back as 2000+ BCE.
Because the United States, and especially the American West, was not heavily
settled until much more recently compared to most of Europe and Asia, it was a
place for people to experiment with new ideas in urban design. The natural hu­
man tendency to impose order on habitation location had ample room to do just
that. The easiest and most efficient way to organize space is using a coordinate
grid, with streets intersecting at perpendicular angles. Salt Lake City, Albuquer­
que, Phoenix, and Seattle are notable examples of grid cities. An interesting hy­
brid structure exists in Washington DC, which has radiating diagonal avenues
overlaid on a grid.64[IA]

3.3.2.2 Organizing Built Environments
Built environments influence the expectations, behaviors, and experiences of ev­
eryone who enters the space—employees, visitors, customers, and inhabitants
are all subject to the design of the spaces they occupy. These environments can
be designed to encourage or discourage interactions between people, to create
a sense of freedom or confinement, to reward exploration or enforce efficiency,
and of course, much much more. The arrangement of the resources in a built
environment also encourages or discourages interactions, and sometimes the
built environment is designed with a specific collection of resources in mind to
enable and reinforce some particular interaction goals or policies.
104

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

If we contrast the built environments of museums, airports, and casinos, and the
way in which each of them facilitates or constrains interactions are more obvi­
ous. Museums are often housed in buildings designed as architectural monu­
ments that over time become symbols of national, civic, or cultural identity.
Many old art museums mimic classical architecture, with grand stairs flanked
by tall columns. They have large and dramatic entry halls that invite visitors in­
side. Modern museums are decidedly less traditional, and some people complain
that the architecture of modern art museums can overshadow the art collection
contained within because people are induced to pay more attention to the build­
ing than to its contents.
Some recently built airports have been designed with architectural flair, but air­
port design is more concerned with efficiency, walkability (maybe with the aid of
moving walkways), navigability, and basic comfort for travelers getting in and
out the airport. Wide walkways, multiple staircases, and people movers whose
doors open in one direction at a time, all encourage people to move in certain
directions, sometimes without the people even realizing they are being directed.
If you have ever been lost in a casino or had trouble finding the exit you can be
sure you experienced a casino that achieved its main design goals: keeping peo­
ple inside and making it easy for them to lose track of time because they lack
both windows and clocks. As American architect Robert Venturi points out, “The
intricate maze under the low ceiling never connects with outside light or out­
side space...This disorients the occupant in space and time... He loses track of
where he is and when it is.”
If one accepts the premise that values and bias are at work in decisions about
organizing systems, it is difficult not to see it in built environments. Consider
queue design in banks, supermarkets, or boarding airplanes. Assuming that it is
desirable to organize people efficiently to minimize wait times and crowding,
how should the queue be designed? How many categories of people should
there be? What is the basis for the categories?
It may be uncontroversial to include several express lanes in a supermarket
checkout, because people can choose to buy fewer items if they do not want to
wait. Similarly, it seems essential for hospital emergency rooms to have a triage
policy that selects patients from the emergency room queue based on their like­
ly benefit from immediate medical attention.
There are many other examples of how values and biases become part of built
environments. In the mid-20th century the road systems of Long Island in New
York were designed with low overpasses, which prevented public buses from
passing under them, effectively segregating the beaches. The trend in college
campus design after the student protests of the 1960s and 1970s was to create
layouts that would prevent or frustrate large demonstrations.67[Phil]

3.3.2.3 Orientation and Wayfinding Mechanisms
It is easy to move through an environment and stay oriented if the design is sim­
ple and consistent, but most built environments must include additional features
or descriptions to assist people in these tasks. Distinctive architectural elements
can create landmarks for orientation, and spaces can be differentiated with col­
or, lighting, furnishings, or other means. More ubiquitous mechanisms include
signs, room numbers, or directional arrows highlighting the way and distance to
important destinations.
In airports, for example, there are many orientation signs and display terminals
that help passengers find their departure gates, baggage, or ground transporta­
tion services. In contrast, casinos provide little orientation and navigation sup­
port because increased confusion leads to lengthier visits, and more gambling
on the part of the casino’s visitors.
A recent innovation in wayfinding and orientation mechanisms is to give them
sensing and communication capabilities so they can identify people by their
smartphones and then provide personalized directions or information. These socalled “beacon” systems have been deployed at numerous airports, including
London's Gatwick, San Francisco, and Miami. 68[IA]

3.3.3 Organizing Digital Resources
Organizing systems that arrange digital resources like digital documents or in­
formation services have some important differences from those that organize
physical resources. Because digital resources can be easily copied or inter­
linked, they are free from the “one place at a time” limitation.69[Law] The actual
storage locations for digital resources are no longer visible or very important. It
hardly matters if a digital document or video resides on a computer in Berkeley
or Bangalore if it can be located and accessed efficiently.70[Web]
Moreover, because the functions and capabilities of digital resources are not di­
rectly manifested as physical properties, the constraints imposed on all material
objects do not matter to digital content in many circumstances.71[Com]
An organizing system for digital resources can also use digital description re­
sources that are associated with them. Since the incremental costs of adding
processing and storage capacity to digital organizing systems are small, collec­
tions of both primary digital resources and description resources can be arbitra­
rily large. Digital organizing systems can support collections and interactions at
a scale that is impossible in organizing systems that are entirely physical, and
they can implement services and functions that exploit the exponentially grow­
ing processing, storage and communication capabilities available today. This all
sounds good, unless you are the small local business with limited onsite

Materiality

digital humanities is the require­
ment to recognize the materiality of
the environment that enables peo­
ple to create and interact with digi­
tal resources Even if the resources
themselves are intangible, it can be
necessary to study and preserve the
technological and social context in
which they exist to fully understand
them.

There are inherently more arrange­
ments of digital resources than there
are for physical ones, but this differ­
ence emerges because of multiple im­
plementation platforms for the organ­
izing system as much as in the nature
of the resources. Nevertheless, the
organizing systems for digital books,
music and video collections often
maintain the distinctions embodied in
the organizing system for physical resources because it enables their coexistence or simply because of legacy inertia. As a result, the organizing sys­
tems for collections of digital resources tend to be coarsely distinguished by me­
dia type (e.g., document management, digital music collection, digital video col­
lection, digital photo collection, etc.).
Information resources in either physical or digital form are typically organized
using intrinsic properties like author names, creation dates, publisher, or the set
of words that they contain. Information resources can also be organized using
assigned properties like subject classifications, names, or identifiers. Informa­
tion resources can also be organized using behavioral or transactional proper­
ties collected about individuals or about groups of people with similar interac­
tion histories. For example, Amazon and Netflix use browsing and purchasing
behavior to make book and movie recommendations.74[Com]
Complex organization and interactions are possible when organizing systems
with digital resources are based on the data type or data model of the digital
content (e.g., text, numeric, multimedia, statistical, geospatial, logical, scientif­
ic, personnel, and so on).
Interactions with numeric data can be further distinguished according to the
levels of measurement embodied in the number, which determine how much
quantitative processing makes sense:
• Nominal level data uses a number as an identifier for an instance or a cate­
gory to distinguish it from other ones. Products in a catalog might have
numbers associated with them, but the products have no intrinsic order, so
no measurements using the numbers are meaningful other than the frequen­
cy with which they occur in the dataset. The most frequently occurring value
is called the mode.

The Discipline of Organizing

• Ordinal level data indicates a direction or ranking on some naturally ordered
scale. We know that the first place finisher in a race came in ahead of the
second place one, who finished ahead of the third place finisher, but this re­
sult conveys no information about the spacing among the racers at the finish
line. The middle value in a sorted list is the median.
• Interval level data conveys order information, but in addition, the values that
subdivide the scale are equally spaced. This makes it meaningful to calculate
the distance between values, the mean or average value (the value for which
the sum of its absolute distances to each other value is zero), the standard
deviation, and other descriptive statistics about the data.
• Ratio level data is interval data with a fixed zero point, which makes asser­
tions about proportions meaningful. $10,000 is twice as much as $5,000.
These distinctions are data type and levels of measurement are often strongly
identifiable with business functions: operational, transactional, process control,
and predictive analytics activities require the most fine-grained data and quanti­
tative measurement scales, while strategic functions might rely on more qualita­
tive analyses represented in narrative text formats.
Just as there are many laws and regulations that restrict the organization of
physical resources, there are laws and regulations that constrain the arrange­
ments of digital ones. Many information systems that generate or collect trans­
actional data are prohibited from sharing any records that identify specific peo­
ple. Banking, accounting, and legal organizing systems are made more homoge­
neous by compliance and reporting standards and rules.

3.3.3.1 Organizing Web-based Resources
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the most inherent scheme for organizing
web resources. Top-level domains for countries (.us, .jp, .cn, etc.) and generic
resource categories (.com, .edu. .org, gov, etc.) provide some clues about the re­
sources organized by a website. These clues are most reliable for large estab­
lished enterprises and publishers; we know what to expect at ibm.com, Berke
ley.edu, and sfgov.org.76[Web]
The network of hyperlinks among web resources challenges the notion of a col­
lection, because it makes it impractical to define a precise boundary around any
collection smaller than the complete web.77[Web] Furthermore, authors are in­
creasingly using “web-native” publication models, creating networks of articles
that blur the notions of articles and journals. For example, scientific authors are
interconnecting scientific findings with their underlying research data, to
discipline-specific data repositories, or to software for analyzing, visualizing,
simulation, or otherwise interacting with the information.78[Web]

Organizing Mental Resources
Memories can be viewed either as physical (because at some level they are
represented in the brain) or as digital (because they are retrieved as electri­
cal impulses), but memory techniques like the method of loci and memory
palaces reify this duality in an interesting way.
While physical resources must be stored in physical locations, our powerful
spatial memory provides an opportunity for us to, in a sense, store mental
resources in physical locations. Our hippocampus, the brain component
dedicated to memory, is highly developed for storing and recalling memo­
ries of physical locations. The ancient Greeks relied on this capability and
devised a mnemonic system—the method of loci—which involved attaching
things to remember, the key ideas in a speech perhaps, to well-known physi­
cal locations. While giving the speech, then, all one must do is imagine
walking through that physical location from idea to idea. Today, champion
memorizers use this technique to associate items with places in vividly im­
agined “memory palaces.” While you may not be interested in memorizing
the order of a deck of cards, recognizing the power of our spatial memory
may be worth considering when designing your organizing system or when
analyzing the successes or failures of a system.75[CogSci]
The conventional library is both a collection of books and the physical space in
which the collection is managed. On the web, rich hyper linking and the fact
that the actual storage location of web resources is unimportant to the end
users fundamentally undermine the idea that organizing systems must collect
resources and then arrange them under local control to be effective. The spec­
tacular rise during the 1990s of the AOL “walled garden,” created on the as­
sumption that the open web was unreliable, insecure, and pernicious, was for a
time a striking historical reminder and warning to designers of closed resource
collections until its equally spectacular collapse in the following decade.79[Web]
But Facebook so far is succeeding by following a walled garden strategy.

3.3.3.2 “Information Architecture” and Organizing Systems
The discipline known as information architecture can be viewed as a specialized
approach for designing the information models and their systematic manifesta­
tions in user experiences on websites and in other information-intensive organ­
izing systems.80[IA] Abstract patterns of information content or organization are
sometimes called architectures, so it is straightforward from the perspective of
the discipline of organizing to define the activity of information architecture as
designing an abstract and effective organization of information and then expos­
ing that organization to facilitate navigation and information use. Note how the

3.3 Organizing Resources

109

The Discipline of Organizing

first part of this definition refers to intentional arrangement of resources, and
the second to the interactions enabled by that arrangement.
Our definition of information architecture implies a methodology for the design
of user interfaces and interactions that puts conceptual modeling at the founda­
tion. Best practices in information architecture emphasize the use of systematic
principles or design patterns for organizing the resources and interactions in
user interfaces. The logical design is then translated into a graphical design
that arranges windows, panes, menus, and other user interface components.
The logical and graphical organization of a user interface together affect how
people interact with it and the actions they take (or do not take).
Some information design conventions have become design patterns. Documents
use headings, boxes, white space, and horizontal rules to organize information
by type and category. Large type signifies more important content than small
type, red type indicates an advisory or warning, and italics or bold says “pay at­
tention.”
Some patterns are general and apply to an entire website, page, or interface
genre such as a government site, e-commerce site, blog, social network site,
home page, “about us” page, and so on. Other patterns are more specific and
affect a part of a site or a single component of a page (e.g., autocompletion of a
text field, breadcrumb menu, slideshow).
In websites, different categories of content or interactions are typically ar­
ranged in different menus. The choices within each menu are then arranged to
reflect typical workflows or ordered according to some commonly used property
like size, percentage, or price.
All design patterns reflect and reinforce the user's past experiences with con­
tent and interface components, and this familiarity reduces the cognitive com­
plexity of user interface interaction, requiring users to pay less attention.82[IA]

The Activities of Information Architecture
IA is a relatively new field, but the ubiquity of the web and informationintensive applications that must implement many types of user interactions
has inspired many conceptual and methodological innovations. Here are
some of them.
Selecting Resources: To make good choices about what content to include in
an information system or service, methods and tools for creating and organ­
izing the information that is potentially available are important. Glushko
and McGrath's method for creating a “Document Inventory” and Halvorson
and Rach's “Information Inventory” both use a matrix or grid format to list
information sources and various associated properties. Once the inventory
is completed, the information must be evaluated with respect to the user
and information requirements. This usually requires a more fine-grained
analysis to choose the most reliable or reusable source when there are al­
ternatives. This process is usually called content auditing, and tools or tem­
plates for organizing the work are easy to find on the web.
Organizing Resources: Tidwell proposes a set of design patterns for input
forms, text and graphic editors, information graphics, calendars, and other
common types of web applications that organize resources. Morville and
Rosenfield classify design patterns as “organization schemes” and “organi­
zation structures,” reinforcing the idea that information architecture is a
sub-specialty of the discipline of organizing.
Designing Interactions: Kalbach presents design patterns and implementa­
tions for navigation interactions. Resmini and Rosati discuss architectures
and examples for information architectures that interconnect physical and
digital channels. Marcotte introduces techniques for adapting user interfa­
ces to the size and capabilities of different devices, collectively called re­
sponsive web design.
Information architects use a variety of tools for representing information
and process models. Common ones include site maps, workflow and data­
flow diagrams, and wireframe models. Brown's Communicating Design and
Abel and Baillie's The Language of Content Strategy are concise sour­
ces.81[IA]
However, interface designers can take advantage of this familiarity and employ
design patterns in a less beneficial way to manipulate users, control their be­
haviors, or trick them into taking actions they do not intend. Patterns used this
way are sometimes called Dark Patterns (page 112).
Many organizing systems need to support interactions to find, identify, and se­
lect resources. Some of these systems contain both physical and digital
3.3 Organizing Resources

111

The Discipline of Organizing

Dark Patterns
Some websites and applications employ Dark Patterns, which rely on user
familiarity with good design patterns to induce users to take actions or fail
to take actions in ways counter to their best interests. For example, a web­
site may exploit familiar patterns to induce users to click on an ad disguised
as a news item, sign up for unwanted e-mails, disclose personal information,
or ignore important terms and conditions because they are buried in tiny
text or in unusual locations.
Darkpatterns.org collects and classifies dark patterns. The largest catego­
ries are “bait and switch” (suggest one action but cause another), “trick
questions” (misleading phrasing of an option), and “misdirection” (focusing
attention on one thing to distract from another). The website has numerous
examples of interfaces that try to get users to install additional software or
change their defaults to a company’s product during installation. Other ex­
amples are from commerce sites that conceal the cheapest options, add ad­
ditional fees at the very end of the purchase process, or make it difficult to
accurately compare costs.
These practices are enough of a concern that some governments have be­
gun to regulate the information that must be provided to consumers when
purchasing digital products. The Directive on Consumer Rights published by
the European Commission in June 2014 contains instructions about design
choices that should be avoided, such as allowing additional purchases and
payments without the consumer’s consent. The Directive even includes a
model set of patterns to help designers comply with it.83[Law]
Dark patterns can be used to manipulate interactions with physical resour­
ces too. Gas pumps with three or four grades of gasoline invariably arrange
the pumps in order of price, with the cheapest gas at the left and the most
expensive on the right. Some gas stations put the cheapest gas in the mid­
dle, which causes inattentive customers who are relying on the usual pat­
tern to buy more expensive gas than they intended.
resources, as in a bookstore with both web and physical channels, and many in­
teractions are implemented across more than one device. Both the crosschannel and multiple-device situations create user expectations that interac­
tions will be consistent across these different contexts. Starting with a concep­
tual model and separating content and structure from presentation, as we dis­
cussed in §1.6, gives organizing systems more implementation alternatives and
makes them more robust in the face of technology diversity and change.
A model-based foundation is also essential in information visualization applica­
tions, which depict the structure and relationships in large data collections us­

112

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

ing spatial and graphical conventions to enable user interactions for exploration
and analysis. By transforming data and applying color, texture, density, and oth­
er properties that are more directly perceptible, information visualization appli­
cations enable people to obtain more information than they can from text dis­
plays.84[CogSci]
Some designers of information systems put less emphasis on conceptual model­
ing as an “inside-out” foundation for interaction design and more emphasis on
an “outside-in” approach that highlights layout and other presentation-tier con­
siderations with the goal of making interactions easy and enjoyable. This focus
is typically called user experience design, and information architecture methods
remain an important part of it, but not beginning with explicit organizing princi­
ples implies more heuristic methods and yields less predictable results.

3.3.4 Organizing With Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics, about a collection or dataset, summarize it concisely and
can identify the properties that might be most useful as organizing principles.
The simplest statistical description of a collection is how big it is; how many re­
sources or observations does it contain?
Descriptive statistics summarize a collection of resources or dataset with two
types of measures:
• Measures of central tendency: Mean, median, and mode; which measure is
appropriate depends on the level of measurement represented in the num­
bers being described (these measures and the concept of levels of measure­
ments are defined in §3.3.3 Organizing Digital Resources (page 106)).
• Measures of variability: Range (the difference between the maximum and
minimum values), and standard deviation (a measure of the spread of values
around the mean).
Statistical descriptions can be created for any resource property, with the sim­
plest being the number of resources that have the property or some particular
value of it, such as the number of times a particular word occurs in a document
or the number of copies a book has sold. Comparing summary statistics about a
collection with the values for individual resources helps you understand how
typical or representative that resource is. If you can compare your height of 6
feet, ½ inch with that of the average adult male, which is 5 feet, 10 inches, the
difference is two and a half inches, but what does this mean? It is more informa­
tive to make this comparison using the standard deviation, which is three in­
ches, because this tells you that 68% of adult men have heights between 5 feet,
7 inches and 6 feet, 1 inch. When measurements are normally distributed in the
familiar bell-shaped curve around the mean, the standard deviation makes it
easy to identify statistical outliers.
3.3 Organizing Resources

113

The Discipline of Organizing

No matter how measurements are distributed, it can be useful to employ de­
scriptive statistics to organize resources or observations into categories or
quantiles that have the same number of them. Quartiles (4 categories), deciles
(10), and percentiles (100) are commonly used partitions.
Alternatively, resources or observations can be organized by visualizing them in
a histogram, which divides the range of values into units with equal intervals.
Because values tend to vary around some central tendency, the intervals are un­
likely to contain the same number of observations. Descriptive statistics and as­
sociated visualizations can suggest which properties make good organizing
principles because they exhibit enough variation to distinguish resources in
their most useful interactions. For example, it probably isn’t useful to organize
books according to their weight because almost all books weigh between ½ and
2 pounds, unless you are in the business of shipping books and paying accord­
ing to how much they weigh.

3.3.4.1 Exploratory Analysis to Understand Data
Many experts recommend that data analysts should undertake some exploratory
analysis with descriptive statistics and simple information visualizations to un­
derstand their data before applying sophisticated computational techniques to
the dataset. In particular, because the human visual system quickly perceives
shapes and patterns, analyzing and graphing the values of data attributes and
other resource descriptions can suggest which properties might be useful and
comprehensible organizing principles. In addition, data visualization makes it
easy to recognize values that are typical or that are outliers. Some of this analy­
sis might form part of data quality assessment during resource selection, but if
not done then, it should be done as part of the organizing process.
A dataset whose fields or attributes lack information about data types and units
of measure has little use because the data lacks meaning. When some, but not
all parts of the data are named or annotated, avoid over-interpreting these de­
scriptions’ meanings. (See §4.4 Naming Resources (page 188).)

We will do some exploratory analysis to understand what an example dataset
contains and how we might use it. For our example, we consider a collection of
a few hundred records from a healthcare study, whose first eight records and
first five data fields in each record are shown in Figure 3.2a, Example Dataset.

The “ID” column contains numeric data, but every value is a different integer,
and the values are contiguous. The field label “ID” suggests that this is the re­
source identifier for the participants in the healthcare study. Further examina­
tion of other tables will reveal that this is a key value that points into a different
dataset containing the resource names.
The “Sex” column is also numeric, but there are only two different values, 0 and
1, and in the complete dataset they are approximately equal in frequency. This
attribute seems to be categorical or Boolean data. This makes sense for a “Sex”
categorization, and it is likely to prove useful in understanding the dataset.

Figure 3.2b. Temperature

The data values of the “Temp” column follow the familiar normal or bell-shaped
distribution, for which simple and useful descriptive statistics are the mean and
the standard deviation. The mean (or average) is at the center of the distribu­
tion, and the standard deviation captures the width of the bell shape. In this da­
taset, the very narrow range of data values here suggests that this attribute is
not useful as an organizing principle, since it does not distinguish the resources
in any significant way. In a larger sample, however, there might be a few very
low or very high temperatures, and it would be useful to investigate these “hy­
pothermic” or “hyperthermic” outliers.
The data values of the “Age” column range from 18 to 97, and are spread broad­
ly across the entire range; this is the age, in years, of the study participants.
When a distribution is very broad and flat, or highly skewed with many values at
one end or another, the mean value is less useful as a descriptive statistic. In­
stead of the mean, it is better to use the median or middle value as a summary
of the data; the median value for “Age” in the complete dataset is 39.

The “Weight” column has about 220 different numeric values, from 82 to 300,
and judging from this range we can infer that the weights are measured in
pounds. The data follows an uneven distribution with peaks around 160 and
200, and a small peak at 300. This odd shape appears in the histogram of Fig­
ure 3.2d, Weight. The two peaks in this so-called multi-modal histogram suggest
that this measure is mixing two different kinds of resources, and indeed it is be­
cause weights of men and women follow different distributions. It would thus be
useful to use the categorical “Sex” data to separate these populations, and Fig­
ure 3.2e, Sex and Weight: Female shows how analyzing weight for women and
men as different populations is much more informative as an organizing princi­
ple than combining them.
What about the odd peak in the distribution at 300? End of range anomalies like
this generally reflect a limitation in the device or system that created the data.
In this case, the weight scale must have an upper limit of 300 pounds, so the
peak represents the people whose weight is 300 or greater.

3.3.4.2 Detecting Errors and Fraud in Data
There are numerous techniques for evaluating individual data items or datasets
to ensure that they have not been changed or corrupted during transmission,
storage, or copying. These include parity bits, check digits, check sums, and
cryptographic hash functions. They share the idea that a calculation will yield
some particular value or match a stored result when the original data has not
been changed. Another basic technique for detecting errors is to look for data
values that are different or anomalous because they do not fall into expected
ranges or categories.
More interesting challenges arise when the data might have been changed by
intentional actions to commit fraud, launder money, or carry out some other
crime. In these situations, the person tampering with data or creating fake data
will try to make the data look normal or expected.
Forensic accountants and statisticians use many techniques for detecting possi­
bly fraudulent data in these adversarial contexts. Some are quite simple:
• If expenses are reimbursed up to some maximum allowed value, look for da­
ta items with that exact value.
• When any value exceeding some threshold triggers more careful analysis,
look for other data items just below that threshold.
• When invoices or claims are paid on receipt, and only a sample are subse­
quently audited, look for duplicate submissions.
• Calculate the ratio of the maximum to the minimum value for purchases in
some category (such as the unit price paid for items from suppliers); items
with large ratios might indicate fraud where the supplier “kicks back” some
of the money to the purchaser.
Benford’s Law, the observation that the leading digits in data sets are distrib­
uted in a non-uniform manner, is an effective technique for detecting fraudulent
data because it is based on a counter-intuitive fact not known to most fraud­
sters, who often make up data to look random. You might think that the number
1 would occur 11% of the time as the first digit (since there are 9 possibilities),
but for data sets whose values span several orders of magnitude, the number 1
is the first digit about 30% of the time, and 7, 8, and 9 occur around 5%.
Because of the very high transaction rate and the relatively small probability of
fraud, credit card fraud is detected using machine learning algorithms. The
classifier is trained with known good and bad transactions using properties like
average amount, frequency, and location to develop a model of each cardhold­
er’s “data behavior” so that a transaction can quickly be assigned a probability
that it is fraudulent. (More about this kind of computational classification in
Chapter 7, Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types.)86[DS]

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

3.3.5 Organizing with Multiple Resource Properties
Multiple properties of the resources, the person organizing or intending to use
them, and the social and technological environment in which they are being or­
ganized can collectively shape their organization. For example, the way you or­
ganize your home kitchen is influenced by the physical layout of counters, cabi­
nets, and drawers; the dishes you cook most often; your skills as a cook, which
may influence the number of cookbooks, specialized appliances and tools you
own and how you use them; the sizes and shapes of the packages in the pantry
and refrigerator; and even your height.
If multiple resource properties are considered in a fixed order, the resulting ar­
rangement forms a logical hierarchy. The top level categories of resources are
created based on the values of the property evaluated first, and then each cate­
gory is further subdivided using other properties until each resource is classi­
fied in only a single category. Consider the hierarchical system of folders used
by a professor to arrange the digital resources on his computer; the first level
distinguishes personal documents from work-related documents; work is then
subdivided into teaching and research, teaching is subdivided by year, and year
divided by course.
For physical resources, mapping categories to physical locations is another re­
quired step; for example, resources in the “kitchen utensils” category might all
be arranged in drawers near a workspace, with “silverware” arranged more
precisely to separate knives, forks, and spoons.
An alternative to hierarchical organization that is often used in digital organiz­
ing systems is faceted classification, in which the different properties for the re­
sources can be evaluated in any order. For example, you can select wines from
the wine.com store catalog by type of grape, cost, or region and consider these
property facets in any order. Three people might each end up choosing the same
moderately-priced Kendall Jackson California Chardonnay, but one of them
might have started the search based on price, one based on the grape varietal,
and the third with the region. This kind of interaction in effect generates a dif­
ferent logical hierarchy for every different combination of property values, and
each user made his final selection from a different set of wines.
Faceted classification allows a collection of description resources to be dynami­
cally re-organized into as many categories as there are combinations of values
on the descriptive facets, depending on the priority or point of view the user ap­
plies to the facets. Of course this only works because the physical resources are
not themselves being rearranged, only their digital descriptions.
Applications that organize large collections of digital information, including
those for search, natural language processing, image classification, personal­

ized recommendation, and other computationally intensive domains, often use
huge numbers of resource properties (which are often called “features” or “di­
mensions”). For example, in document collections each unique word might ini­
tially be treated as a feature by machine learning algorithms, so there might be
tens of thousands of features.
Chapter 8, Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories explains principles
and methods for hierarchical and faceted classification in more detail.

3.4 Designing Resource-based Interactions
We need to focus on the interactions that are enabled because of the intentional
acts of description or arrangement that transform a collection of resources into
an organizing system. With physical resources, it is easy to distinguish the inter­
actions that are designed into and directly supported by an organizing system
because of intentional acts of description or arrangement from those that can
take place with resources after they have been accessed. For example, when a
book is checked out of a library it might be read, translated, summarized, criti­
cized, or otherwise used—but none of these interactions would be considered a
capability of the book that had been designed into the library. Some physical re­
sources can initiate interactions, as surely “human resources” and “smart” ob­
jects with sensors and other capabilities can, but most physical resources are
passive. We will discuss this idea of resource agency in §4.2.3.
In contrast, in organizing systems that contain digital resources the logical
boundary between the resources and their interactions is less clear because
what you can do with a digital resource is often not apparent. Furthermore,
some of the interactions that are outside of the boundary with physical resour­
ces can be inside of it with digital ones. For example, when you check a printed
book out of the library, it is no longer in the library when you translate it. But a
digital book in the Google Books library is not removed when you start reading
it, and a language translation service runs “inside” of it.
Additional issues in the design of interactions with resources are whether users
have direct or mediated access to the resources, and whether they interact with
the resources themselves or only with copies or descriptions of them. For exam­
ple, users have direct access to original resources in a collection when they
browse through library stacks or wander in museum galleries. Users have medi­
ated or indirect access when they use catalogs or search engines. Because digi­
tal resources can be easily reproduced, it can be difficult to distinguish a copy
from the original, which raises questions of authenticity we will discuss in
§4.5.3.

3.4.1 Affordance and Capability
The concept of affordance, introduced by J. J. Gibson, then extended and popu­
larized by Donald Norman, captures the idea that physical resources and their
environments have inherent actionable properties that determine, in conjunc­
tion with an actor’s capabilities and cognition, what can be done with the re­
source.88[CogSci]
Including capabilities and cognition brings accessibility considerations into the
definition of affordance. A resource is only accessible when it supports interac­
tions, and it is ineffective design to implement interactions with resources that
some people are unable to perform. A person who cannot see text cannot read
it, or if they are confined to a wheelchair they cannot select a book from a tall
library shelf. Describing or transforming resources to ensure their accessibility
is discussed in greater detail in §3.4.2.3 Accessibility (page 129).
When organizing resources involves arranging physical resources using boxes,
bins, cabinets, or shelves, the affordances and the implications for access and
use can be easily perceived. Resources of a certain size and weight can be
picked up and carried away. Books on the lower shelves of bookcases are easy
to reach, but those stored ten feet from the ground cannot be easily accessed.
We can analyze the organizing systems with physical resources to identify the
affordances and the possible interactions they imply. We can compare the affor­
dances or overall interaction capability enabled by different organizing systems
for some type of physical resources, and we often do this without thinking about
it. The tradeoffs between the amount of work that goes into organizing a collec­
tion of resources and the amount of work required to find and use them are in­
escapable when the resources are physical objects or information resources are
in physical form. We can immediately see that storing information on scrolls
does not enable the random access capability that is possible with books.
What and how to count to compare the capabilities of organizing systems be­
comes more challenging the further we get from collections of static physical
resources, like books or shoes, where it is usually easy to perceive and under­
stand the possible interactions. With computers, information systems, and digi­
tal resources in general, considerations about affordances and capabilities are
not as straightforward.
First, the affordances we can perceive might not be tied to any useful interac­
tion. Donald Norman joked that every computer screen within reaching distance
affords touching, but unless the display is touch-sensitive, this affordance only
benefits companies that sell screen-cleaning materials.89[CogSci]
Second, most of the interactions that are supported by digital resources are not
apparent when you encounter them. You cannot tell from their names, but you
probably know from past experience what interactions are possible with files of
3.4 Designing Resource-based Interactions

123

The Discipline of Organizing

types “.doc” and “.pdf.” You probably do not know what interactions take place
with “.xpi” and “.mobi” files.90[Com]
A similar difficulty exists when we look at resource descriptions and data collec­
tions, where we often cannot tell just by examining their values what kinds of
interactions and operations with them are sensible. Think of all the different
kinds of information that might be associated with a collection of people like the
students in a university. A database might contain student names, student IDs,
gender, birth dates, addresses, a numeric code for academic major, course units
completed, grade point average, and other information. These pieces of infor­
mation differ in their data type; some are integers, some are real numbers,
some are Boolean, and some are just text strings. The numeric data also differs
in the level of measurement it represents. Student IDs and the academic major
codes are nominal data, the house or apartment number in the address is ordi­
nal data, and the course units and grade point average are interval data. Data
type and level of measurement influence the kind of interactions that are mean­
ingful; we can create an alphabetical list of students using their last names,
count up the number of students with the same academic major, and calculate
the average GPA or units completed. But it makes no sense to use the numeric
codes for academic major to compute an average major.
Once you have discovered it, the capability of digital resources and information
systems can be assessed by counting the number of functions, services, or appli­
cation program interfaces. However, this very coarse measure does not take in­
to account differences in the capability or generality of a particular interaction.
For example, two organizing systems might both have a search function, but dif­
ferences in the operators they allow, the sophistication of pre-processing of the
content to create index terms, or their usability can make them vastly differ in
power, precision, and effectiveness.91[Com]
An analogous measure of functional capability for a system with dynamic or liv­
ing resources is the behavioral repertoire, the number of different activities, or
range of actions, that can be initiated.
We should not assume that supporting more types of interactions necessarily
makes a system better or more capable; what matters is how much value is cre­
ated or invoked in each interaction. A smartphone cluttered with features and
apps you never use enables a great many interactions, but most of them add lit­
tle value. Doors that open automatically when their sensors detect an approach­
ing person do not need handles or require explicit interactions. Organizing sys­
tems can use stored or computed information about user preferences or past in­
teractions to anticipate user needs or personalize recommendations. This has
the effect of substituting information for interaction to make interactions unnec­
essary or simpler.

124

Informatics Edition

For example, a “smart travel agent” service can use a user’s appointment calen­
dar, past travel history, and information sources like airline and hotel reserva­
tion services to transform a minimal interaction like “book a business trip to
New York for next week’s meeting” into numerous hidden queries that would
have otherwise required separate interactions. These queries are interconnec­
ted by logical or causal dependencies that are represented by information that
overlaps between them. For example, all travel-related services (airlines, hotels,
ground transportation) need the traveler’s identity and the time and location of
his travel. A New York trip might involve all of these services, and they need to
fit together in time and location for the trip to make sense. The hotel reserva­
tion needs to begin the day the flight arrives in the destination city, the limou­
sine service needs to meet the traveler shortly after the plane lands, and the
restaurant reservation should be convenient in time and location to the ho­
tel.92[DS]

3.4.2 Interaction and Value Creation
A useful way to distinguish types of interactions with resources is according to
the way in which they create value, using a classification proposed by Apte and
Mason. They noted that interactions differ not just in their overall intensity but
in the absolute and relative amounts of physical manipulation, interpersonal or
empathetic contact, and symbolic manipulation or information exchange in­
volved in the interaction.
Furthermore, Apte and Mason recognized that the proportions of these three
types of value creating activities can be treated as design parameters, especial­
ly where the value created by retrieving or computing information could be
completely separated from the value created by physical actions and person-toperson encounters. This configuration of value creation enables automated selfservice, in which the human service provider can be replaced by technology,
and outsourcing, in which the human provider is separated in space or time
from the customer.93[Bus]

3.4.2.1 Value Creation with Physical Resources
Physical manipulation is often the intrinsic type of interaction with collections of
physical resources. The resource might have to be handled or directly perceived
in order to interact with it, and often the experience of interacting with the re­
source is satisfying or entertaining, making it a goal in its own right. People of­
ten visit museums, galleries, zoos, animal theme parks or other institutions that
contain physical resources because they value the direct, perceptual, or other­
wise unmediated interaction that these organizing systems support.
Physical manipulation and interpersonal contact might be required to interact
with information resources in physical form like the printed books in libraries.

3.4 Designing Resource-based Interactions

125

The Discipline of Organizing

However, for most people the primary purpose of interacting with a library is to
access the information contained in its resources. Many people prefer accessing
digital documents or books to accessing the original physical resource because
the incidental physical and interpersonal interactions are unnecessary. In addi­
tion, many library searches are for known items, which is easily supported by
digital search.
In some organizing systems robotic devices, computational processes, or other
entities that can act autonomously with no need for a human agent carry out in­
teractions with physical resources. Robots have profoundly increased efficiency
in materials management, “picking and packing” in warehouse fulfillment, office
mail delivery, and in many other domains where human agents once located, re­
trieved, and delivered physical resources. A “library robot” system that can lo­
cate books and grasp them from the shelves can manage seven times as many
books in the same space used by conventional open stacks.
Interactions with physical resources often have highly tangible results; in the
preceding examples of fulfillment and delivery interactions, resources move
from one location to another. However, an abstract or architectural perspective
on interaction design and value creation can create more flexibility in carrying
out the interactions while still producing the expected value for the user. In gen­
eral, more abstract descriptions of interactions and services allow for transpar­
ent substitution of the implementation, potentially enabling a computational
process to be a substitute for one carried out by a person, or vice versa.
For example, a user buying from an internet-based store need not know and
probably does not care which service delivers the package from the warehouse.
Presenting the interaction to the shopper as the “delivery service” rather than
as a “FedEx” or “UPS” service allows the retailer to choose the best service pro­
vider for each delivery. Going even further, if you need printed documents at a
conference, sales meeting, or anywhere other than your current location, the in­
teraction you desire is “provide me with documents” and not “deliver my docu­
ments.” It does not matter that FedEx will print your documents at their desti­
nation rather than shipping them there.

3.4.2.2 Value Creation with Digital Resources
With digital resources, neither physical manipulation nor interpersonal contact
is required, and the essence of the interaction is information exchange or sym­
bolic manipulation of the information contained in the resource. Put another
way, by replacing interactions that involve people and physical resources with
symbolic ones, organizing systems can lower costs without reducing user satis­
faction. This is why so many businesses have automated their informationintensive processes with self-service technology.

Library Robot

An automated robot library system at San Francisco State University.
The automated robot library system installed by the Dematic Group stores
books in bins stacked on three-story-tall metal racks in five long aisles. In­
stead of using a library classification scheme, books are stored according to
their sizes in one-foot deep metal bins, which contain about one hundred
books each. Given an online catalog request for a book, the system looks up
the bin where it was last stored, and then directs a robot to bring that bin
to the circulation desk. Human librarians then find the requested book in
the bin and scan its barcode, which notifies the requester that the book can
be picked up. To store a book, the librarian scans its barcode, and it is then
stored in the closest bin with available space.

Similarly, web search engines eliminate the physical effort required to visit a li­
brary and enable users to consult more readily accessible digital resources. A
search engine returns a list of the page titles of resources that can be directly
accessed with just another click, so it takes little effort to go from the query re­
sults to the primary resource.98[Web]

3.4 Designing Resource-based Interactions

127

The Discipline of Organizing

The ease of use and speed of search engines in finding web resources creates
the expectation that any resource worth looking at can be found on the web.
This is certainly false, or Google would never have begun its ambitious and au­
dacious project to digitize millions of books from research libraries. While re­
search libraries strive to provide access to authoritative and specialized resour­
ces, the web is undeniably good enough for answering most of the questions or­
dinary users put to search engines, which largely deal with everyday life, popu­
lar culture, personalities, and news of the day.
Libraries recognize that they need to do a better job integrating their collec­
tions into the “web spaces” and web-based activities of their users if they hope
to change the provably suboptimal strategies of “information foraging” most
people have adopted that rely too much on the web and too little on the li­
brary.99[Web] Some libraries are experimenting with Semantic Web and “Linked
Data” technologies that would integrate their extensive bibliographic resources
with resources on the open web.100[Web]
Museums have aggressively embraced the web to provide access to their collec­
tions. While few museum visitors would prefer viewing a digital image over ex­
periencing an original painting, sculpture, or other physical artifact, the alterna­
tive is often no access at all. Most museum collections are far larger than the
space available to display them, so the web makes it possible to provide access
to otherwise hidden resources.
The variety and functions of interactions with digital resources are determined
by the amount of structure and semantics represented in their digital encoding,
in the descriptions associated with the resources, or by the intelligence of the
computational processes applied to them. Digital resources can support en­
hanced interactions of searching, copying, zooming, and other transformations.
Digital or “ebooks” demonstrate how access to content can be enhanced once it
is no longer tied to the container of the printed book, but ebook readers vary
substantially in their interaction repertoires; the baseline they all share is “page
turning,” resizing, and full-text search.102[Com]
To augment digital resources with text structures, multimedia, animation, inter­
active 3-D graphics, mathematical functions, and other richer content types re­
quires much more sophisticated representation formats that tend to require a
great deal of “hand-crafting.” An alternative to hand-crafted resource descrip­
tion is sophisticated computer processing guided by human inputs. For example,
Facebook and many web-based photo organizing systems implement face recog­
nition analysis that detects faces in photos, compares features of detected faces
to features of previously identified faces, and encourages people to tag photos
to make the recognition more accurate. Some online services use similar image
classification techniques to bring together shoes, jewelry, or other items that
look alike.

Richer interactions with digital text resources are possible when they are enco­
ded in an application or presentation-independent format. Automated content
reuse and “single-source publishing” is most efficiently accomplished when text
is encoded in XML, but much of this XML is produced by transforming text orig­
inally created in word processing formats. Once it is in XML, digital information
can be distributed, processed, reused, transformed, mixed, remixed, and recom­
bined into different formats for different purposes, applications, devices, or
users in ways that are almost impossible to imagine when it is represented in a
tangible (and therefore static) medium like a book on a shelf or a box full of pa­
per files.103[Com]
Businesses that create or own their information resources can readily take ad­
vantage of the enhanced interactions that digital formats enable. For libraries,
however, copyright is often a barrier to digitization, both as a matter of law and
because digitization enables copyright enforcement to a degree not possible
with physical resources.
As a result, digital books are somewhat controversial and problematic for libra­
ries, whose access models were created based on the economics of print publi­
cation and the social contract of the copyright first sale doctrine that allowed li­
braries to lend printed books.104[Law]
Software-based agents do analogous work to robots in “moving information
around” after accessing digital resources such as web services or physical re­
sources with sensors attached that produce digital information. Agents can con­
trol or choreograph a set of interactions with digital resources to carry out com­
plex business processes.

3.4.2.3 Accessibility
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recog­
nizes accessibility to information and communications technologies as a basic
human right. There is also a strong business case for accessibility: studies show
that accessible websites are used more often, are easier to maintain, and pro­
duce better search results.105[Phil]
Many of the techniques for making a resource accessible involve transforming
the resource or its description into a different form so someone who could not
perceive it or interact with it in its original form can now do so. The most com­
mon operating systems all come with general-purpose accessibility features
such as reading text aloud, recognizing speech, magnifying text, increasing cur­
sor size, signaling with flashing lights instead of with sounds, lights to signal
keyboard shortcuts for selecting and navigating, and connecting to devices for
displaying Braille. Google Translate converts text in one language to another,
and many people use it to create a rough draft that is finished by a human trans­
lator.106[Com]
3.4 Designing Resource-based Interactions

129

The Discipline of Organizing

Other techniques are not generic and automatic, and instead require investment
by authors or designers to make information accessible. Websites are more ac­
cessible when images or other non-text content types have straightforward ti­
tles, captions, and “alt text” that describes what they are about. Consistent
placement and appearance of navigation controls and interaction widgets is es­
sential; for example, in a shopping site “My Cart” might always be found at the
top right corner of the page.107[Web]
If authors apply semantic and structural markup to the text and use formats
that distinguish it from presentation instructions, page outlines and summaries
can be generated to enhance navigation, and search can be made more precise
by limiting it to particular sections or content types. As the “Information IQ” of
the source format increases, more can be done to make it more accessible (see
§4.2.2 Resource Format (page 169) and Figure 4.3, Information IQ.).108[Web]
The Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC invites visitors to record audio de­
scriptions on mobile devices of the nearly 137 million objects in its collection,
and then makes these available to everyone. This is just a small part of its ef­
forts to make its exhibits more accessible. A company called D-Scriptive enables
blind people to enjoy Broadway shows more by recording hundreds of audio de­
scriptions that are synchronized with dialog spoken by the actors.
Transforming recorded spoken language to text to make it accessible and
searchable is called transcription. At times transcription is necessary to comply
with accessibility requirements, but is often done simply to add organization to
content, as when a script is created to separate the multiple voices in a radio or
television interview or story.
Transcriptions created by skilled people are highly accurate but labor-intensive
to produce, so speech-to-text software is increasingly being used to transcribe
speech using pre-trained acoustic and language models. Training these models
is computationally intensive, and there are many clever techniques to acquire
the “labeled” inputs. However, most of them are conceptually simple; they take
the huge amount of data collected by voice search applications and analyze
what the searcher does with the results to assess the accuracy of the transcrip­
tion. Transcription accuracy can be improved when models can be specialized
by industry or application. For example, speech-to-text software for doctors is
trained to recognize medical terminology, while software for use by generic
voice recognition services like Apple's is trained to understand dictation and
commands or questions one would ask of a smartphone.
Since text transcripts are machine-readable, unlike audio or video files, adding
text transcripts makes it possible for search engines to index audio and video in
ways that were previously impossible. Pop Up Archive, an audio search compa­
ny in Oakland, California, works with speech-to-text software specially trained
for news media and spoken word content to make radio, podcasts, and archival
130

audio searchable. A challenge for audio search is that even though a transcrip­
tion with a few mistakes works just fine for search engines, people often expect
transcriptions to be perfect.110[Com]
When the speech is in a language that is not understood, it needs to be transla­
ted as well. Perhaps you have watched a movie on an international flight and
were able to choose from subtitles in many different languages. Creating subti­
tles for a foreign film is an asynchronous task that is substantially easier task
than doing a real-time translation, and the demand for skilled translators for
speeches and other synchronous situations (and interpreters, who translate
speech to sign language for people with hearing disabilities) remains high.

3.4.3 Access Policies
Different levels of interactions or access can apply to different resources in a
collection or to different categories of users. For example, library collections
can range from completely open and public, to allowing limited access, to whol­
ly private and restricted.
Because of their commercial and competitive purposes, organizing systems in
business domains are more likely to enforce a granular level of access control
that distinguishes people according to their roles and the nature of their inter­
actions with resources. For example, administrative assistants in a company’s
Human Resources department are not allowed to see salaries; HR employees in
a benefits administration role can see salaries but not change them;
management-level employees in HR can change the salaries. Some firms limit
access to specific times from authorized computers or IP addresses.111[Bus]
A noteworthy situation arises when the person accessing the organizing system
is the one who designed and implemented it. In this case, the person will have
qualitatively better knowledge of the resources and the supported interactions.
This situation most often arises in the organizing systems in kitchens, home
closets, and other highly personal domains but can also occur in knowledgeintensive business and professional domains like consulting, customer relation­
ship management, and scientific research.
Many of the organizing systems used by individuals are embedded in physical
contexts where access controls are applied in a coarse manner. We need a key
to get into the house, but we do not need additional permissions or passwords
to enter our closets or to take a book from a bookshelf. In our online lives, how­
ever, we readily accept and impose more granular access controls. For example,
we might allow or block individual “friend” requests on Facebook or mark pho­
tos on Flickr as public, private, or viewable only by named groups or individu­
als.
We can further contrast access policies based on their origins or motivations.

3.4 Designing Resource-based Interactions

131

The Discipline of Organizing

Designed resource access policies are established by the designer or operator
of an organizing system to satisfy internally generated requirements. Examples
of designed access policies are:
• giving more access to “inside” users (e.g., residents of a community, stu­
dents or faculty members at a university, or employees of a company) than
to anonymous or “outside” users;
• giving more access to paying users than to users who do not pay;
• giving more access to users with capabilities or competencies that can add
value to the organizing system (e.g., material culture researchers like ar­
chaeologists or anthropologists, who often work with resources in museum
collections that are not on display).
Imposed Policies are mandated by an external entity and the organizing system
must comply with them. For example, an organizing system might have to follow
information privacy, security, or other regulations that restrict access to resour­
ces or the interactions that can be made with them.
University libraries typically complement or replace parts of their print collec­
tions with networked access to digital content licensed from publishers. Typical
licensing terms then require them to restrict access to users that are associated
with the university, either by being on campus or by using virtual private net­
work (VPN) software that controls remote access to the library network.112[Law]
Copyright law limits the uses of a substantial majority of the books in the collec­
tions of major libraries, prohibiting them from being made fully available in digi­
tal formats. Museums often prohibit photography because they do not own the
rights to modern works they display.
Whether an access policy is designed or imposed is not always clear. Policies
that were originally designed for a particular organizing system may over time
become best practices or industry standards, which regulators or industry
groups not satisfied with “self-regulation” later impose. Museums might aggres­
sively enforce a ban on photography not just to comply with copyright law, but
also to enhance the revenue they get from selling posters and reproductions.

3.5 Maintaining Resources
Maintaining resources is an important activity in every organizing system be­
cause resources must be available at the time they are needed. Beyond these
basic shared motivations are substantial differences in maintenance goals and
methods depending on the domain of the organizing system.
However, different domains sometimes use the same terms to describe different
maintenance activities and different terms for similar activities. Common main­
tenance activities are storage, preservation, curation, and governance. Storage
is most often used when referring to physical or technological aspects of main­
taining resources; backup (for short-term storage), archiving (for long-term
storage), and migration (moving stored resources from one storage device to
another) are similar in this respect. The other three terms generally refer to ac­
tivities or methods that more closely overlap in meaning; we will distinguish
them in §3.5.2 through §3.5.4.
Selection and maintenance are interdependent. Selection is based on an initial
set of rules that determine which resources enter the organizing system. Main­
tenance includes the work to preserve the resources, the processes for evaluat­
ing and revising the original selection criteria, and the removal of resources
from the system when they no longer need to be preserved. More stringent
rules for selecting resources generally imply a maintenance plan that carefully
enforces the same constraints that limit selection. This is just common sense
whether the resource is a piece of art, an automobile, a software package, or a
star basketball player; if you worked hard to find or paid a lot to acquire a re­
source, you are going to take care of it and will not soon be buying another one.
Ideally, maintenance requirements for resources should be anticipated when or­
ganizing principles are defined and implemented. Resource descriptions to sup­
port preservation of digital resources are especially important.

3.5.1 Motivations for Maintaining Resources
The concept of memory institution broadly applies to a great many organizing
systems that share the goal of preserving knowledge and cultural heritage. The
primary resources in libraries, museums, data archives or other memory institu­
tions are fixed cultural, historic, or scientific artifacts that are maintained be­
cause they are unique and original items with future value. This is why the Mu­
sée du Louvre preserves the portrait of the Mona Lisa and the United States Na­
tional Archives preserves the Declaration of Independence.
In contrast, in businesses organizing systems, many of the resources that are
collected and managed have limited intrinsic value. The motivation for preserva­
tion and maintenance is economic; resources are maintained because they are
3.5 Maintaining Resources

133

The Discipline of Organizing

essential in running the business. For example, businesses collect and preserve
information about employees, inventory, orders, invoices, etc., because it en­
sures internal goals of efficiency, revenue generation, and competitive advant­
age. The same resources (e.g., customer information) are often used by more
than one part of the business.116[Bus] Maintaining the accuracy and consistency
of changing resources is a major challenge in business organizing systems.117[DS]
Many business organizing systems preserve information needed to satisfy exter­
nally imposed regulatory or compliance policies and serve largely to avoid possi­
ble catastrophic costs from penalties and lawsuits. In all these cases, resources
are maintained as one of the means employed to preserve the business as an on­
going enterprise, not as an end in itself.
Unlike libraries, archives, and museums, indefinite preservation is not the cen­
tral goal of most business organizing systems. These organizing systems mostly
manage information needed to carry out day-to-day operations or relatively re­
cent historical information used in decision support and strategic planning. In
addition to these internal mandates, businesses have to conform to securities,
taxation, and compliance regulations that impose requirements for long-term in­
formation preservation.118[Law]
In between these contrasting purposes of preservation and maintenance are the
motives in personal collections, which occasionally are created because of the
inherent value of the items but more typically because of their value in support­
ing personal activities. Some people treasure old photos or collectibles that be­
longed to their parents or grandparents and imagine their own children or
grandchildren enjoying them, but many old collections seem to end up as offer­
ings on eBay. In addition, many personal organizing systems are task-oriented,
so their contents need not be preserved after the task is completed.120[CogSci]

3.5.2 Preservation
At the most basic level, preservation of resources means maintaining them in
conditions that protect them from physical damage or deterioration. Libraries,
museums, and archives aim for stable temperatures and low humidity. Perma­
nently or temporarily out-of-service aircraft are parked in deserts where dry
conditions reduce corrosion. Risk-aware businesses create continuity plans that
involve off-site storage of the data and documents needed to stay in business in
the event of a natural disaster or other disruption.
When the goal is indefinite preservation, other maintenance issues arise if re­
sources deteriorate or are damaged. How much of an artifact’s worth is locked
in with the medium used to express it? How much restoration should be attemp­
ted? How much of an artifact's essence is retained when digitized?

134

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

3.5.2.1 Digitization and Preserving Resources
Preservation is often a key motive for digitization, but digitization alone is not
preservation. Digitization creates preservation challenges because technologi­
cal obsolescence of computer software and hardware require ongoing efforts to
ensure the digitized resources can be accessed.
Technological obsolescence is the major challenge in maintaining digital resour­
ces. The most visible one is a result of the relentless evolution of the physical
media and environments used to store digital information in both institutional or
business and personal organizing systems. Computer data began to be stored
on magnetic tape and hard disk drives six decades ago, on floppy disks four dec­
ades ago, on CDs three decades ago, on DVDs two decades ago, on solid-state
drives half a decade ago, and in “cloud-based” or “virtual” storage environ­
ments in the last decade. As the capacity of storage technologies grows, eco­
nomic and efficiency considerations often make the case to adopt new technolo­
gy to store newly acquired digital resources and raise questions about what to
do with the existing ones.121[Com]
The second challenge might seem paradoxical. Even though digital storage ca­
pacity increases at a staggering pace, the expected useful lifetimes of the physi­
cal storage media are measured in years or at best in decades. Colloquial terms
for this problem are data rot or “bit rot.” In contrast, books printed on acid-free
paper can last for centuries. The contrast is striking; books on library shelves do
not disappear if no one uses them, but digital data can be lost if no one wants
access to it within a year or two after its creation.122[Com]
However, limits to the physical lifetime of digital storage media are much less
significant than the third challenge, the fact that the software and its associated
computing environment used to parse and interpret the resource at the time of
preservation might no longer be available when the resource needs to be ac­
cessed. Twenty-five years ago most digital documents were created using the
Word Perfect word processor, but today the vast majority is created using Mi­
crosoft Word and few people use Word Perfect today. Software and services that
convert documents from old formats to new ones are widely available, but they
are only useful if the old file can be read from its legacy storage medium.
Because almost every digital device has storage associated with it, problems
posed by multiple storage environments can arise at all scales of organizing sys­
tems. Only a few years ago people often struggled with migrating files from
their old computer, music player or phone when they got new ones. Web-based
email and applications and web-based storage services like Dropbox, Amazon
Cloud Drive, and Apple iCloud eliminate some data storage and migration prob­
lems by making them someone else’s responsibility, but in doing so introduce
privacy and reliability concerns.

3.5 Maintaining Resources

135

The Discipline of Organizing

It is easy to say that the solutions to the problems of digital preservation are
regular recopying of the digital resources onto new storage media and then mi­
grating them to new formats when significantly better ones come along. In prac­
tice, however, how libraries, businesses, government agencies or other enterpri­
ses deal with these problems depends on their budgets and on their technical
sophistication. In addition, not every resource should or can always be migra­
ted, and the co-existence of multiple storage technologies makes an organizing
system more complex because different storage formats and devices can be col­
lectively incompatible.
(Interoperability and integration are discussed in Chapter 10, Interactions with
Resources.)

3.5.2.2 Preserving the Web
Preservation of web resources is inherently problematic. Unlike libraries, muse­
ums, archives, and many other kinds of organizing systems that contain collec­
tions of unchanging resources, organizing systems on the web often contain re­
sources that are highly dynamic. Some websites change by adding content, and
others change by editing or removing it.124[Web]
Longitudinal studies have shown that hundreds of millions of web pages change
at least once a week, even though most web pages never change or change in­
frequently.125[Web] Nevertheless, the continued existence of a particular web page
is hardly sufficient to preserve it if it is not popular and relevant enough to show
up in the first few pages of search results. Persistent access requires preserva­
tion, but preservation is not meaningful if there is no realistic probability of fu­
ture access.
Comprehensive web search engines like Google and Bing use crawlers to con­
tinually update their indexed collections of web pages and their search results
link to the current version, so preservation of older versions is explicitly not a
goal. Furthermore, search engines do not reveal any details about how fre­
quently they update their collections of indexed pages.126[Web]

3.5.2.3 Preserving Resource Instances
A focus on preserving particular resource instances is most clear in museums
and archives, where collections typically consist of unique and original items.
There are many copies and derivative works of the Mona Lisa, but if the original
Mona Lisa were destroyed none of them would be acceptable as a replacement.
Zoos often give a distinctive or attractive animal a name and then market it as a
special or unique instance. For example, the Berlin Zoo successfully marketed a
polar bear named Knut to become a world famous celebrity, and the zoo made
millions of dollars a year through increased visits and sales of branded

The Internet Archive and the “Wayback Machine”
The Internet Archive (Archive.org), founded by Brewster Kahle, makes pres­
ervation of the web its first and foremost activity, and when you enter a URI
into its “Wayback Machine” you can see what a site looked like at different
moments in time. For example, www.berkeley.edu was archived about 2500
times between October 1996 and January 2013, including about twice a
week on average during all of 2012. Even so, since a large site like berke­
ley.edu often changes many times a day, the Wayback Machine’s preserva­
tion of berkeley.edu is incomplete, and it only preserves a fraction of the
web’s sites. Since 2006 the Internet Archive has hosted the “Archive-It”
service to enable hundreds of schools, libraries, historical societies, and oth­
er institutions to archive collections of digital resources.
merchandise. Merchandise sales have continued even though Knut died unex­
pectedly in March 2011, which suggests that the zoo was less interested in pre­
serving that particular polar bear than in preserving the revenue stream based
on that resource.
Most business organizing systems, especially those that “run the business” by
supporting day-to-day operations, are designed to preserve instances. These in­
clude systems for order management, customer relationship management, in­
ventory management, digital asset management, record management, email ar­
chiving, and more general-purpose document management. In all of these do­
mains, it is often necessary to retrieve specific information resources to serve
customers or to meet compliance or traceability goals.
Recent developments in sensor technology enable very extensive data collection
about the state and performance of machines, engines, equipment, and other
types of physical resources, including human ones. (Are you wearing an activity
tracker right now?) When combined with historical information about mainte­
nance activity, predictive analytics techniques can use this data to determine
normal operating ranges and indicators of coming performance degradation or
failures. Predictive maintenance can maximize resource lifetimes while minimiz­
ing maintenance and inventory costs. These techniques have recently been used
to predict when professional basketball players are at risk of an injury, poten­
tially enabling NBA teams to identify the best time to rest their star players
without impairing their competitive strategy.131[DS]

3.5.2.4 Preserving Resource Types

“Shamu” the Killer Whale

Some business organizing systems
are designed to preserve types or
classes of resources rather than re­
source instances. In particular, sys­
tems for content management typical­
ly organize a repository of reusable or
“source” information resources from
which specific “product” resources
are then generated. For example, con­
tent management systems might con­
tain modular information about a
company’s products that are assem­
bled and delivered in sales or product
catalogs, installation guides, operat­
ing guides, or repair manuals.132[Com]

Businesses strive to preserve the col­
lective knowledge embodied in the
company’s people, systems, manage­
ment techniques, past decisions, cus­

agement is the reuse of “knowledge
as type,” putting the focus on the knowledge rather than the specifics of how it
found its way into the organizing system.
Libraries have a similar emphasis on preserving resource types rather than in­
stances. The bulk of most library collections, especially public libraries, is made
up of books that have many equivalent copies in other collections. When a li­
brary has a copy of Moby Dick it is preserving the abstract work rather than the
particular physical instance—unless the copy of Moby Dick is a rare first edition
signed by Melville.

Even when zoos give their popular animals individual names, it seems logical
that the zoo’s goal is to preserve animal species rather than instances because
any particular animal has a finite lifespan and cannot be preserved forev­
er.134[Bus]

3.5.2.5 Preserving Resource Collections
In some organizing systems any specific resource might be of little interest or
importance in its own right but is valuable because of its membership in a col­
lection of essentially identical items. This is the situation in the data warehouses
used by businesses to identify trends in customer or transaction data or in the
huge data collections created by scientists. These collections are typically ana­
lyzed as complete sets. A scientist does not borrow a single data point when she
accesses a data collection; she borrows the complete dataset consisting of mil­
lions or billions of data points. This requirement raises difficult questions about
what additional software or equipment need to be preserved in an organizing
system along with the data to ensure that it can be reanalyzed.135[DS]

3.5.3 Curation
For almost a century curation has referred to the processes by which a resource
in a collection is maintained over time, which may include actions to improve
access or to restore or transform its representation or presentation.
Curation takes place in all organizing systems—at a personal scale when we re­
arrange a bookshelf to accommodate new books or create new file folders for
this year’s health insurance claims, at an institutional scale when a museum de­
signs a new exhibit or a zoo creates a new habitat, and at web scale when peo­
ple select photos to upload to Flickr or Facebook and then tag or “Like” those
uploaded by others.
An individual, company, or any other creator of a website can make decisions
and employ technology that maintains the contents, quality and character of the
site over time. In that respect website curation and governance practices are lit­
tle different than those for the organizing systems in memory institutions or
business enterprises. The key to curation is having clear policies for collecting
resources and maintaining them over time that enable people and automated
processes to ensure that resource descriptions or data are authoritative, accu­
rate, complete, consistent, and non-redundant.

3.5 Maintaining Resources

139

The Discipline of Organizing

3.5.3.1 Institutional Curation
Curation is most necessary and explicit in institutional organizing systems
where the large number of resources or their heterogeneity requires choices to
be made about which ones should be most accessible, how they should be or­
ganized to ensure this access, and which ones need most to be preserved to en­
sure continued accessibility over time. Curation might be thought of as an ongo­
ing or deferred selection activity because curation decisions must often be
made on an item-by-item basis.

3.5.3.2 Individual Curation
Curation by individuals has been studied a great deal in the research discipline
of Personal Information Management (PIM).140[CogSci] Much of this work has been
influenced for decades by a seminal article written by Vannevar Bush titled “As
We May Think.” Bush envisioned the Memex, “a device in which an individual
stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so
that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.” Bush’s most influ­
ential idea was his proposal for organizing sets of related resources as “trails”
connected by associative links, the ancestor of the hypertext links that define to­
day’s web.141[Com]

3.5.3.3 Social and Web Curation
Many individuals spend a great amount of time curating their own websites, but
when a site can attract large numbers of users, it often allows users to annotate,
“tag,” “like,” “+1,” and otherwise evaluate its resources. The concept of cura­
tion has recently been adapted to refer to these volunteer efforts of individuals
to create, maintain, and evaluate web resources.142[Web] The massive scale of
these bottom-up and distributed activities is curation by “crowdsourcing,” the
continuously aggregated actions and contributions of users.143[Web]
The informal and organic “folksonomies” that result from their aggregated ef­
fort create organization and authority through network effects.144[Web] This un­
dermines traditional centralized mechanisms of organization and governance
and threatens any business model in publishing, education, and entertainment
that has relied on top-down control and professional curation.145[Bus] Professional
curators are not pleased to have the ad hoc work of untrained people working
on websites described as curation.
Most websites are not curated in a systematic way, and the decentralized nature
of the web and its easy extensibility means that the web as a whole defies cura­
tion. It is easy to find many copies of the same document, image, music file, or

140

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

video and not easy to determine which is the original, authoritative or author­
ized version. Broken links return “Error 404 Not Found” messages.146[Web]
Problems that result from lazy or careless webmastering are minor compared to
those that result from deliberate misclassification, falsification, or malice. An
entirely new vocabulary has emerged to describe these web resources with bad
intent: “spam,” “phishing,” “malware,” “fakeware,” “spyware,” “keyword stuff­
ing,” “spamdexing,” “META tag abuse,” “link farms,” “cybersquatters,” “phan­
tom sites,” and many more.147[Com] Internet service providers, security software
firms, email services, and search engines are engaged in a constant war against
these kinds of malicious resources and techniques.148[Com]
Since we cannot prevent these deceptions by controlling what web resources
are created in the first place, we have to defend ourselves from them after the
fact. “Defensive curation” techniques include filters and firewalls that block ac­
cess to particular sites or resource types, but whether this is curation or censor­
ship is often debated, and from the perspective of the government or organiza­
tion doing the censorship it is certainly curation. Nevertheless, the decentral­
ized nature of the web and its open protocols can sometimes enable these con­
trols to be bypassed.

3.5.3.4 Computational Curation
Search engines continuously curate the web because the algorithms they use
for determining relevance and ranking determine what resources people are
likely to access. At a smaller scale, there are many kinds of tools for managing
the quality of a website, such as ensuring that HTML content is valid, that links
work, and that the site is being crawled completely. Another familiar example is
the spam and content filtering that takes place in our email systems that auto­
matically classifies incoming messages and sorts them into appropriate folders.
One might think that computational curation is always more reliable than any
curation carried out by people. Certainly, it seems that we should always be able
to trust any assertion created by context-aware resources like temperature or
location sensors. But can we trust the accuracy of web content? Search engines
use the popularity of web pages and the structure of links between them to
compute relevance. But popularity and relevance do not always ensure accura­
cy. We can easily find popular pages that prove the existence of UFOs or claim
to validate wacky conspiracy theories.
Computational curation is more predictable than curation done by people, but
search engines have long been accused of bias built into their algorithms. For
example, Google’s search engine has been criticized for giving too much credi­
bility to websites with .edu domain names, to sites that have been around for a
long time, or that are owned by or that partner with the company, like Google
Maps or YouTube.149[DS]
3.5 Maintaining Resources

141

The Discipline of Organizing

In organizing systems that contain data, there are numerous tools for name
matching, the task of determining when two different text strings denote the
same person, object, or other named entity. This problem of eliminating dupli­
cates and establishing a controlled or authoritative version of the data item ari­
ses in numerous application areas but familiar ones include law-enforcement
and counter-terrorism. Done incorrectly, it might mean that you end up on a
“watch list” and experience difficulties every time you want to fly commercially.
An extremely promising new approach to computational curation involves using
scientific measuring equipment to analyze damaged physical resources and then
building software models of the resources that can be manipulated to restore
the resources or otherwise improve access to their content. For example, the
first sound recordings were made using rotating wax cylinders; sounds caused a
diaphragm to vibrate, the pattern of vibration was transferred into a connected
stylus, which then cut a groove into the wax. When the cylinder was rotated
past a passive stylus, it would vibrate according to the groove pattern, and the
amplified vibrations could be heard as the replayed sound. Unfortunately, wax
cylinders from the 19th century are now so fragile that they would fall apart if
they were played. This dilemma was resolved by Carl Haber, an experimental
physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Haber used image processing
techniques to convert microscope-detailed scans of the grooves in the wax cylin­
ders. Measurements of the grooves could then be transformed to reproduce the
sounds captured in the grooves.
A second example of computational curation applied to digital preservation is
work done by a research team led by Melissa Terras and Tim Weyrich at Univer­
sity College London to build a 3-dimensional model of a 17th-century “Great
Parchment Book” damaged in an 18th-century fire. The parchment was singed,
shriveled, creased, folded, and nearly impossible to read (see website). After
traditional document restoration techniques (e.g., illustrated in photos in §3.5.2)
went as far as they could, the researchers used digital image capture and mod­
eling techniques to create a software model of the parchment that could stretch
and flatten the digital document to discover text hidden by the damage.

3.5.3.5 Discarding, Removing, and Not Keeping
So far, we have discussed maintenance as activities involved in preserving and
protecting resources in an organizing system over time. An essential part of
maintenance is the phasing out of resources that are damaged or unusable, ex­
pired or past their effectivity dates, or no longer relevant to any interaction.
Many organizations admit to a distinct lack of strategy in the removal aspect of
maintenance. A firm with outdated storage technology might have to discard
older data simply to make room for new data, and might do so without consider­
ing that keeping some summary statistics would be valuable for historical analy­

142

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

sis. Other firms might be biased towards keeping information just because they
went to the trouble of collecting or acquiring it. Some amount of “intelligent”
removal is an essential ingredient in any maintenance regime, and a popular
book argues forcefully for continually discarding resources from personal or­
ganizing systems as a method of focusing on the resources that really matter.
In memory institutions, common terms for getting rid of resources include dis­
carding, de-accession, de-selection, and weeding.
Other domains have other mechanisms and terms for removing resources. Em­
ployess are removed by firing, layoff, or retirement . Athletes are cut or waived
or sent down from a sports team if their performance deteriorates.
Keeping an organizing system current often involves some amount of elimina­
tion of older resources in order to make space for the new: in fashion retail, the
floor is constantly restocked with the latest styles. Software development teams
will halt active support and documentation efforts of legacy versions.
Information resources are often discarded to comply with laws about retaining
sensitive data. Governments and office holders sometimes destroy documents
that might prove damaging or embarrassing if they are discovered through
Freedom of Information requests or by opposing political parties.
More positively, the “right to be forgotten” movement and intentional destruc­
tion of information records about prior bankruptcy, credit problems, or juvenile
arrests after a certain period of time has passed can be seen as a policy of “so­
cial forgetfulness” that gives people a chance to get on with their lives.152[Law]
Some people have difficulty in discarding things, regardless of their actual val­
ue. This behavior is called hoarding, and is now regarded as a kind of obsessivecompulsive disorder that requires treatment because it can cause emotional,
physical, social, and even legal problems for the hoarder and family members. It
seems unsympathetic that many TV shows and stories have been produced
about especially compulsive hoarding. A famous example is that of the Collyer
brothers in New York, who shut themselves off from the world for years, and
when they were found dead inside their home in 1947 it contained 140 tons of
collected items, including 25,000 books, fourteen pianos, thousands of bottles
and tin cans, hundreds of yards of fabrics, and even a Model T car chassis.

The Discipline of Organizing

3.5.4 Governance
Governance overlaps with curation in meaning, but typically has more of policy
focus (what should be done), rather than a process focus (how to do it). Gover­
nance is also more frequently used to describe curation in business and scientif­
ic organizing systems rather than in libraries, archives, and museums. Gover­
nance has a broader scope than curation because it extends beyond the resour­
ces in a collection and also applies to the software, computing, and networking
environments needed to use them. This broader scope also means that gover­
nance must specify the rights and responsibilities for the people who might in­
teract with the resources, the circumstances under which that might take place,
and the methods they would be allowed to use.
Corporate governance is a common term applied to the ongoing maintenance
and management of the relationship between operating practices and long-term
strategic goals.
Data governance policies are often shaped by laws, regulations or policies that
prohibit the collection of certain kinds of objects or types of information. Priva­
cy laws prohibit the collection or misuse of personally identifiable information
about healthcare, education, telecommunications, video rental, and in some
countries restrict the information collected during web browsing.155[Law]

3.5.4.1 Governance in Business Organizing Systems
Governance is essential to deal with the frequent changes in business organiz­
ing systems and the associated activities of data quality management, access
control to ensure security and privacy, compliance, deletion, and archiving. For
many of these activities, effective governance involves the design and imple­
mentation of standard services to ensure that the activities are performed in an
effective and consistent manner.156[Bus]
Today’s information-intensive businesses capture and create large amounts of
digital data. The concept of “business intelligence” emphasizes the value of data
in identifying strategic directions and the tactics to implement them in market­
ing, customer relationship management, supply chain management and other
information-intensive parts of the business.157[Bus] A management aspect of gov­
ernance in this domain is determining which resources and information will po­
tentially provide economic or competitive advantages and determining which
will not. A conceptual and technological aspect of governance is determining
how best to organize the useful resources and information in business opera­
tions and information systems to secure the potential advantages.
Business intelligence is only as good as the data it is based on, which makes
business data governance a critical concern that has rapidly developed its own

specialized techniques and vocabu­
lary. The most fundamental gover­
nance activity in information-driven
businesses is identifying the “master
data” about customers, employees,
materials, products, suppliers, etc.,
that is reused by different business
functions and is thus central to busi­
ness operations.158[DS]
Because digital data can be easily
copied, data governance policies
might require that all sensitive data
be anonymized or encrypted to re­
duce the risk of privacy breaches. To
identify the source of a data breach or
to facilitate the assertion of a copy­
right infringement claim a digital wa­
termark can be embedded in digital
resources.159[Com]

enced. What secure information

ness’s governance policies and
practices have affected the severity
of the breach? What changes could
the businesses make to protect peo­
ple’s data better?

3.5.4.2 Governance in Scientific Organizing Systems
Scientific data poses special governance problems because of its enormous
scale, which dwarfs the datasets managed in most business organizing systems.
A scientific data collection might contain tens of millions of files and many peta­
bytes of data. Furthermore, because scientific data is often created using speci­
alized equipment or computers and undergoes complex workflows, it can be
necessary to curate the technology and processing context along with data in
order to preserve it. An additional barrier to effective scientific data curation is
the lack of incentives in scientific culture and publication norms to invest in da­
ta retention for reuse by others. 160[Law]

The Long Tail of Dark Data
Almost all scientists admit that they are holding “dark data,” data that has
never been made available to the rest of the scientific community. There
may only be a few scientists worldwide that would want to see a particular
dataset, but there are many thousands of these datasets. Other dark data
comes from research that fails to find effects; because these negative find­
ings are less likely to be published, literature reviews can be skewed by
their omission. Just as Netflix makes the long tail of movies available, per­
haps dark data would become more accessible if it could be could easily up­
loaded to a Netflix for Science. (Heidorn 2008)

3.6 Key Points in Chapter Three
• Selection, organizing, interaction design, and maintenance activities occur
in every organizing system.
(See §3.1 Introduction (page 87))
• These activities are not identical in every domain, but the general terms ena­
ble communication and learning about domain-specific methods and vocabu­
laries.
(See §3.1 Introduction (page 87))
• The most fundamental decision for an organizing system is determining its
resource domain, the group or type of resources that are being organized.
(See §3.2 Selecting Resources (page 92))
• Memory institutions select rare and distinctive resources, but in scientific
research, a sample must contain representative instances.
(See §3.2 Selecting Resources (page 92))
• Even when the selection principles behind a collection are clear and consis­
tent, they can be unconventional, idiosyncratic, or otherwise biased.
(See §3.2.1 Selection Criteria (page 92))
• If you can determine where the resources come from, you can make better
selection decisions by evaluating the people, processes, and organizing sys­
tems that create them.
(See §3.2.2 Looking “Upstream” and “Downstream” to Select Resources
(page 96))
• In this book we use property in a generic and ordinary sense as a synonym
for feature or “characteristic.” Many cognitive and computer scientists are
more precise in defining these terms and reserve property for binary predi­
cates (e.g., something is red or not, round or not). If multiple values are pos­
sible, the property is called an attribute, “dimension,” or “variable.”
(See §3.3 Organizing Resources (page 98))
• Most organizing systems use principles that are based on specific resource
properties or properties derived from the collection as a whole.
(See §3.3 Organizing Resources (page 98))
• There are a huge number of ways to organize people that differ in the extent
of hierarchical structure, the flow of information up and down the hierarchy,
the span of control for managers, and the discretion people have to deviate
or innovate with respect to the work they have been assigned to do.

(See the sidebar, Organizing People into Businesses (page 101))
• Some arrangements of physical resources are constrained or precluded by
resource properties that might cause problems for other resources or for
their users.
(See §3.3.1.1 Organizing with Properties of Physical Resources (page 100))
• There are always multiple interpretations of the sensory stimuli gathered by
our visual system, but the mind imposes the simplest ones: things near each
other are grouped, complex shapes are viewed as simple shapes that are
overlapping, missing information needed to see separate visual patterns as
continuous or whole is filled in, and ambiguous figure-ground illusions are
given one interpretation at a time.
(See the sidebar, Gestalt Principles (page 102))
• Built environments can be designed to encourage or discourage interactions
between people, to create a sense of freedom or confinement, to reward ex­
ploration or enforce efficiency.
(See §3.3.2.2 Organizing Built Environments (page 104))
• It is straightforward from the perspective of the discipline of organizing to
define the activity of information architecture as designing an abstract and
effective organization of information and then exposing that organization to
facilitate navigation and information use.
(See §3.3.3.2 “Information Architecture” and Organizing Systems (page 109))
• The level of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) of data deter­
mines how much quantitative organization of your data will be sensible.
(See §3.3.4 Organizing With Descriptive Statistics (page 113))
• Statistical descriptions summarize a set of resources, and reveal other de­
tails that enable comparison of instances with the collection as a whole
(such as identifying outliers).
(See §3.3.4 Organizing With Descriptive Statistics (page 113))
• Multiple properties of the resources, the person organizing or intending to
use them, and the social and technological environment in which they are
being organized can collectively shape their organization.
(See §3.3.5 Organizing with Multiple Resource Properties (page 121))
• The tradeoff between the amount of work that goes into organizing a collec­
tion of resources and the amount of work required to find and use them is
inescapable when the resources are physical objects or information resour­
ces are in physical form.
(See §3.4.1 Affordance and Capability (page 123))

3.6 Key Points in Chapter Three

147

The Discipline of Organizing

• The concept of affordance, introduced by J. J. Gibson, then extended and
popularized by Donald Norman, captures the idea that physical resources
and their environments have inherent actionable properties that determine,
in conjunction with an actor’s capabilities and cognition, what can be done
with the resource.
(See §3.4.1 Affordance and Capability (page 123))
• We should not assume that supporting more types of interactions necessarily
makes a system better or more capable; what matters is how much value is
created or invoked in each interaction.
(See §3.4.1 Affordance and Capability (page 123))
• A resource is only accessible when it supports interactions, and it is ineffec­
tive design to implement interactions with resources that some people are
unable to perform.
(See §3.4.1 Affordance and Capability (page 123))
• Many of the techniques for making a resource accessible involve transform­
ing the resource or its description into a different form so someone who
could not perceive it or interact with it in its original form can now do so.
(See §3.4.1 Affordance and Capability (page 123))
• With digital resources, the essence of the interaction is information ex­
change or symbolic manipulation of the information contained in the re­
source.
(See §3.4.2.2 Value Creation with Digital Resources (page 126))
• The variety and functions of interactions with digital resources are deter­
mined by the amount of structure and semantics represented in their digital
encoding, in the descriptions associated with the resources, or by the intelli­
gence of the computational processes applied to them.
(See §3.4.2.2 Value Creation with Digital Resources (page 126))
• Preservation of resources means maintaining them in conditions that protect
them from physical damage or deterioration.
(See §3.5.2 Preservation (page 134))
• Preservation is often a key motive for digitization, but digitization alone is
not preservation.
(See §3.5.2.1 Digitization and Preserving Resources (page 135))
• The essence of curation and governance is having clear policies for collect­
ing resources and maintaining them over time that enable people and auto­
mated processes to ensure that resource descriptions or data are authorita­
tive, accurate, complete, consistent, and non-redundant.

Endnotes for Chapter 3
Some governments attempt to preserve and prevent misappropriation of
cultural property by enforcing import or export controls on antiquities that
might be stolen from archaeological sites (Merryman 2006). For digital resour­
ces, privacy laws prohibit the collection or misuse of personally identifiable in­
formation about healthcare, education, telecommunications, video rental, and
might soon restrict the information collected during web browsing.

The popular LinkedIn site, which has hundreds of millions of resumes that
it data mines to find statistically superior job candidates, is literally a gold mine
for the company because it makes money by referring those candidates to po­
tential employers. Data-intensive hiring practices in baseball are entertainingly
presented in the book entitled Moneyball book (Lewis 2003) or the 2011 movie
starring Brad Pitt. Pro football teams have begun to assess college football play­
ers by comparing them statistically with the best pro players (Robbins, 2016).

sible Markup Language (XML) documents in real-time information flows to in­
terconnect the business service components. If the business service components
are described abstractly it can be possible for one service provider to be trans­
parently substituted for another—a kind of real-time resource selection—to
maintain the desired quality of service. For example, a web retailer might send
a Shipping Request to many delivery services, one of which is selected to pro­
vide the service. It probably does not matter to the customer which delivery
service handles his package, and it might not even matter to the retailer.
The idea that a firm’s long term success can depend on just a handful of
critical capabilities that cut across current technologies and organizational
boundaries makes a firm’s core competency a very abstract conceptual model of
how it is organized. This concept was first proposed by (Pralahad and Hamel
1990), and since then there have been literally hundreds of business books that
all say essentially the same thing: you cannot be good at everything; choose
what you need to be good at and focus on getting better at them; let someone
else do things that you do not need to be good at doing.

(Arasu et al. 2001), (Manning et al. 2008). The web is a graph, so all web
crawlers use graph traversal algorithms to find URIs of web resources and then
add any hyperlink they find to the list of URIs they visit. The sheer size of the
web makes crawling its pages a bandwidth- and computation intensive process,
and since some pages change frequently and others not at all, an effective
crawler must be smart at how it prioritizes the pages it collects and how it recrawls pages. A web crawler for a search engine can determine the most rele­
vant, popular, and credible pages from query logs and visit them more often. For
other sites, a crawler adjusts its “revisit frequency” based on the “change fre­
quency” (Cho and Garcia-Molina 2000).
[49][Web]

Web resources are typically discovered by computerized “web crawlers”
that find them by following links in a methodical automated manner. Web crawl­
ers can be used to create topic-based or domain-specific collections of web re­
sources by changing the “breadth-first” policy of generic crawlers to a “bestfirst” approach. Such “focused crawlers” only visit pages that have a high prob­
ability of being relevant to the topic or domain, which can be estimated by ana­
lyzing the similarity of the text of the linking and linked pages, terms in the
linked page’s URI, or locating explicit semantic annotation that describes their
content or their interfaces if they are invokable services (Bergmark et al. 2002),
(Ding et al. 2004).

For example, a personal or small organizing system would typically use
properties that are easy to identify and understand. In contrast, an organizing
system for very large collections of resources, or data about them, would choose
properties that are statistically optimal, even if they are not interpretable by
people, because of the greater need for operational efficiency and predictive ac­
curacy.

Salt Lake City takes the use of a grid to an extreme because the central
area is extremely flat. Streets are named by numbers and letters, so you might
find yourself at the intersection of “North A Street” and “3rd Avenue N,” or at
the intersection of “W 100 S” and “S 200 W.” It is a little creepy to think that
your street address is a pinpoint location in the big grid.

In contrast, Seattle imposes the grid in an abstract way, ignoring the fact that
there are many lakes, rivers, and hills that break up the grid. Streets keep the

same names even though they are not connected, and the grid stretches for
many miles out from its origin in Seattle. You can be up in the mountains at the
corner of “294th Avenue SE” and “472nd Street SE,” giving you precise infor­
mation about your location and nearly 50 mile distance from downtown Seattle.
(See also Pierre Charles L'Enfant's plan for DC at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant)
This is not to say that imposing arbitrary grids on top of a physical environment
to create a simple and easily understood organization is always desirable. It is
essential that any organization imposed on a region be sensitive to any social,
cultural, linguistic, ethnic, or religious organizing systems already in place.
Much of the recent conflict and instability in the Middle East can be attributed
to the implausibly straight line borders drawn by the French and British to
carve up the defeated Ottoman Empire a century ago. Because the newlycreated countries of Syria and Iraq lacked ethnic and religious cohesion, they
could only be held together by dictatorships. (Trofimov 2015)
The designer of the road system, Robert Moses, heralded as the master
builder of mid-20th century New York City, built roads to enforce his idea of who

designed with clearances (often around nine feet) that were too low for public
buses. Consequently, low-income bus riders (largely people of color) had no way
to get to beaches. See (Winner 1980).

In principle, it is easy to make perfect copies of digital resources. In prac­
tice, however, many industries employ a wide range of technologies including
digital rights management, watermarking, and license servers to prevent copy­
ing of documents, music or video files, and other digital resources. The degree
of copying allowed in digital organizing systems is a design choice that is sha­
ped by law.
[69][Law]

Web-based or “cloud” services are invoked through URIs, and good de­
sign practice makes them permanent even if the implementation or location of
the resource they identify changes (Berners-Lee 1998). Digital resources are of­
ten replicated in content delivery networks to improve performance, reliability,
scalability, and security (Pathan et al. 2008); the web pages served by a busy
site might actually be delivered from different parts of the world, depending on
where the accessing user is located.
[70][Web]

Whether a digital resource seems intangible or tangible depends on the
scale of the digital collection and whether we focus on individual resources or
the entire collection. An email message is an identified digital resource in a

standard format, RFC 2822 (Resnick 2001). We can compare different email sys­
tems according to the kinds of interactions they support and how easy it is to
carry them out, but how email resources are represented does not matter to us
and they surely seem intangible. Similarly, the organizing system we use to
manage email might employ a complex hierarchy of folders or just a single
searchable in-box, but whether that organization is implemented in the comput­
er or smart phone we use for email or exists somewhere “in the cloud” for webbased email does not much matter to us either. An email message is tangible
when we print it on paper, but all that matters then is that there is well-defined
mapping between the different representations of the abstract email resource.
On the other hand, at the scale at which Google and Microsoft handle billions of
email messages in their Gmail and Hotmail services the implementation of the
email organizing system is extremely relevant and involves many tangible con­
siderations. The location and design of data centers, the configuration of pro­
cessors and storage devices, the network capacity for delivering messages,
whether messages and folder structures are server or client based, and numer­
ous other considerations contribute to the quality of service that we experience
when we interact with the email organizing system.
For example, a car dealer might be able to keep track of a few dozen new
and used cars on his lot even without a computerized inventory system, but
web-based AutoTrader.com offered more than 2,000,000 cars in 2012. The cars
are physical resources where they are located in the world, but they are repre­
sented in the AutoTrader.com organizing system as digital resources, and cars
can be searched for using any combination of the many resource properties in
the car listings: price, body style, make, model, year, mileage, color, location,
and even specific car features like sunroofs or heated seats.
[73][Web]

Even when organizing principles such as alphabetical, chronological, or
numerical ordering do not explicitly consider physical properties, how the re­
sources are arranged in the “storage tier” of the organizing system can still be
constrained by their physical properties and by the physical characteristics of
the environments in which they are arranged. Books can only be stacked so
high whether they are arranged alphabetically or by frequency of use, and large
picture books often end up on the taller bottom shelf of bookcases because that
is the only shelf they fit. Nevertheless, it is important to treat these idiosyncrat­
ic outcomes in physical storage as exceptions and not let them distort the
choice of the organizing principles in the “logic tier.”

To augment digital resources with text structures, multimedia, anima­
tion, interactive 3-D graphics, mathematical functions, and other richer content
types requires much more sophisticated representation formats that tend to re­
quire a great deal of “hand-crafting.”

[102][Com]

An alternative to hand-crafted resource description is sophisticated computer
processing guided by human inputs. For example, Facebook and many webbased photo organizing systems implement face recognition analysis that de­
tects faces in photos, compares features of detected faces to features of previ­
ously identified faces, and encourages people to tag photos to make the recogni­
tion more accurate. Some online services use similar image classification tech­
niques to bring together shoes, jewelry, or other items that look alike.
Even sophisticated text representation formats such as XML have inher­
ent limitations: one important problem that arises in complex management sce­
narios, humanities scholarship, and bioinformatics is that XML markup cannot
easily represent overlapping substructures in the same resource (Schmidt
2009).

ians have called for boycotts of publishers in response (http://boycottharpercol

In contrast to these new access restrictions imposed by publishers on digital
works, many governments as well as some progressive information providers
and scientific researchers have begun to encourage the reuse and reorganiza­
tion of their content by making geospatial, demographic, environmental, eco­
nomic, and other datasets available in open formats, as web services, or as data
feeds rather than as “fixed” publications (Bizer 2009a), (Robinson et al. 2008).

These access controls to the organizing system or its host computer are
enforced using passwords and more sophisticated software and hardware tech­
niques. Some access control policies are mandated by regulations to ensure pri­
vacy of personal data, and policies differ from industry to industry and from
country to country. Access controls can improve the credibility of information by
identifying who created or changed it, especially important when traceability is
required (e.g., financial accounting).
[111][Bus]

An important difference between interactions with physical resources and those
with digital resources is how they use resource descriptions for access control.

156

Chapter 3 — Activities in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

Resources sometimes have associated security classifications like “Top Secret”
that restrict who can learn about their existence or obtain them. Nonetheless, if
you get your hands on a top secret printed document, nothing can prevent you
from reading it. Similarly, printed resources often have “All rights reserved”
copyright notices that say that you cannot copy them, but nothing can prevent
you from making copies with a copy machine. On the other hand, learning of the
existence of a digital resource might be of little value if copyright or licensing
restrictions prevent you from obtaining it. Moreover, obtaining a digital re­
source might be of no value if its content is only available using a password, de­
cryption key, or other resource description that enforces access control directly
rather than indirectly like the security classifications.
In response to this trend, however, many libraries are supporting “open
access” initiatives that strive to make scholarly publications available without
restriction (Bailey 2007). Libraries and ebook vendors are engaged in a tussle
about the extent to which the “first sale” rule that allows libraries to lend physi­
cal books without restrictions also applies to ebooks (Howard 2011).

Customer information drives day-to-day operations, but is also used in
decision support and strategic planning.
[116][Bus]

For businesses “in the world,” a “customer” is usually an actual person
whose identity was learned in a transaction, but for many web-based businesses
and search engines a customer is a computational model extracted from brows­
er access and click logs that is a kind of “theoretical customer” whose actual
identity is often unknown. These computational customers are the targets of the
computational advertising in search engines.
[117][DS]

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States and similar legislation in
other countries require firms to preserve transactional and accounting records
and any document that relates to “internal controls,” which arguably includes
any information in any format created by any employee (Langevoort 2006). Civil
procedure rules that permit discovery of evidence in lawsuits have long re­
quired firms to retain documents, and the proliferation of digital document
types like email, voice mail, shared calendars and instant messages imposes
new storage requirements and challenges (Levy and Casey 2006). However, if a
company has a data retention policy that includes the systematic deletion of
documents when they are no longer needed, courts have noted that this is not
willful destruction of evidence.
[118][Law]

For example. students writing a term paper usually organize the prin­

tion that proves the rule is the task of paying income taxes for which (in the

This is tautologically true for sites that publish news, weather, product
catalogs with inventory information, stock prices, and similar continually upda­
ted content because many of their pages are automatically revised when events
happen or as information arrives from other sources. It is also true for blogs, wi­
kis, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, Yelp and the great many other “Web 2.0” sites
whose content changes as they incorporate a steady stream of user-generated
content.
[124][Web]

In some cases changes to web pages are attempts to rewrite history and pre­
vent preservation by removing all traces of information that later turned out to
be embarrassing, contradictory, or politically incorrect. When pages cannot be
changed, like the archives of newspapers published on the web, only the search
engine can remove them from search results, and in 2014 the European Court
ruled that people could ask Google to do that.

Because personal collections are strongly biased by the experiences

The most salient example of this so called “community curation” activity
is the work to maintain the Wikipedia open-source encyclopedia according to a
curation system of roles and functions that governs how and under what condi­

In this context, these management and maintenance activities are often
described as “IT governance” (Weill and Ross 2004). Data classification is an es­

This master data must be continually “cleansed” to remove errors or in­

4.1 Introduction
This chapter builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in Chapter 1 to
explain more carefully what we mean by resource. In particular, we focus on the
issue of identity—what will be treated as a separate resource—and discuss the
issues and principles we need to consider when we give each resource a name
or identifier.

The Discipline of Organizing

Navigating This Chapter
In §4.2 Four Distinctions about Resources (page 166) we introduce
four distinctions we can make when we discuss resources: domain,
format, agency, and focus. In §4.3 Resource Identity (page 182) we
apply these distinctions as we discuss how resource identity is deter­
mined for physical resources, bibliographic resources, resources in
information systems, as well as for active resources and smart
things. §4.4 Naming Resources (page 188) then tackles the problems
and principles for naming: once we have identified resources, how do
we name and distinguish them? Finally, §4.5 Resources over Time
(page 198) considers issues that emerge with respect to resources
over time.

4.1.1 What Is a Resource?
Resources are what we organize.
We introduced the concept of resource in §1.3 The Concept of “Resource” (page
35) with its ordinary sense of “anything of value that can support goal-oriented
activity” and emphasized that a group of resources can be treated as a collec­
tion in an organizing system. And what do we mean by “anything of value,” ex­
actly? It might seem that the question of identity, of what a single resource is,
should not be hard to answer. After all, we live in a world of resources, and find­
ing, selecting, describing, arranging, and referring to them are everyday activi­
ties. And while human resources are not a primary focus of this book, it would
be remiss not to explain why it makes sense to think of people that way. See the
sidebar, People as Resources (page 172).
Nevertheless, even when the resources we are dealing with are tangible things,
how we go about organizing them is not always obvious, or at least not obvious
to each of us in the same way at all times. Not everyone thinks of them in the
same way. Recognizing something in the sense of perceiving it as a tangible
thing is only the first step toward being able to organize it and other resources
like it. Which properties garner our attention, and which we use in organizing
depends on our experiences, purposes, and context.
We add information to a resource when we name it or describe it; it then be­
comes more than “it.” We can describe the same resource in many different
ways. At various times we can consider any given resource to be one of many
members of a broad category, as one of the few members of a narrow category,
or as a unique instance of a category with only one member. For example, we
might recognize something as a piece of clothing, as a sock, or as the specific
dirty sock with the hole worn in the heel from yesterday’s long hike. However,

162

even after we categorize something, we might not be careful how we talk about
it; we often refer to two objects as “the same thing” when what we mean is that
they are “the same type of thing.” Indeed, we could debate whether a category
with only one possible member is really a category, because it blurs an impor­
tant distinction between particular items or instances and the class or type to
which they belong.
The issues that matter and the decisions we need to make about resource in­
stances and resource classes and types are not completely separable. Neverthe­
less, we will strive to focus on the former ones in this chapter and the latter
ones in Chapter 7, Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types.

4.1.1.1 Resources with Parts
As tricky as it can be to decide what a resource is when you are dealing with
single objects, it is even more challenging when the resources are objects or
systems composed of other parts. In these cases, we must focus on the entirety
of the object or system and treat it as a resource, treat its constituent parts as
resources, and deal with the relationships between the parts and the whole, as
we do with engineering drawings and assembly procedures.
How many things is a car? If you are imagining the car being assembled you
might think of several dozen large parts like the frame, suspension, drive train,
gas tank, brakes, engine, exhaust system, passenger compartment, doors, and
other pre-assembled components. Of course, each of those components is itself
made up of many parts—think of the engine, or even just the radio. Some sour­
ces have counted ten or fifteen thousand parts in the average car, but even at
that precise granularity a lot of parts are still complex things. There are screws
and wires and fasteners and on and on; really too many to count.
Ambiguity about the number of parts in the whole holds for information resour­
ces too; a newspaper can be considered a single resource but it might also con­
sist of multiple sections, each of which contains separate stories, each of which
has many paragraphs, and so on. Similarly, while a web page can be treated as a
single resource, it can also be considered as a collection of more granular parts,
each of which can be separately identified as the source or anchor of a link.
Likewise, a bank's credit card application might ask about outstanding loans,
payment history, current income, and other information, or the bank might just
look up your credit score, which is a statistical index that combines this finan­
cial information into a single number.

How Many Things is a Chess
Set?

A chess set exemplifies the many dif­
ferent ways to decide what to count
as a separate resource. Is this a chess
set, two sets of chess pieces, six types
of chess pieces (1 king, 1 queen, 2
rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 8 pawns
for each side), or 33 separate things
(the 32 pieces and a board on which
to play the game)?

4.1.1.2 Bibliographic Resources,
Information Components, and
“Smart Things” as Resources
Information resources generally pose
additional challenges in their identifi­
cation and description because their
most important property is usually
their content, which is not easily and
consistently recognizable. Organizing
systems for information resources in
physical form, like those for libraries,
have to juggle the duality of their tan­
gible embodiment with what is inher­
ently an abstract information re­
source; that is, the printed book ver­
sus the knowledge the book contains.
Here, the organizing system emphasi­
zes description resources or surro­
gates, like bibliographic records that
describe the information content,
rather than their physical properties.

Another question about resource that
is especially critical in libraries is:

What set of resources should be trea­

ted as the same work because they
cense.)
contain essentially similar intellectual
or artistic content? We may talk about
Shakespeare’s play Macbeth, but what is this thing we call “Macbeth”? Is it a
particular string of words, saved in a computer file or handwritten upon a folio?
Is it the collection of words printed with some predetermined font and pagina­
tion? Are all the editions and printings of these words the same Macbeth? How
should we organize the numerous live and recorded performances of plays and
movies that share the Macbeth name? What about creations based on or in­
spired by Macbeth that do not share the title “Macbeth,” like the Kurosawa film
“Kumonosu-jo” (Throne of Blood) that transposes the plot to feudal Japan? Pat­
rick Wilson proposed a genealogical analogy, characterizing a work as “a group
or family of texts,” with the idea that a creation like Shakespeare’s Macbeth is
the “ancestor of later members of the family.”
Information system designers and architects face analogous design challenges
when they describe the information components in business or scientific organ­
izing systems. Information content is intrinsically merged or confounded with
structure and presentation whenever it is used in a specific instance and
164

context. From a logical perspective, an order form contains information compo­
nents for ITEM, CUSTOMER NAME, ADDRESS, and PAYMENT INFORMATION,
but the arrangement of these components, their type font and size, and other
non-semantic properties can vary a great deal in different order forms and even
across a single information system that re-purposes these components for let­
ters, delivery notices, mailing labels, and database entries.162[Bus]
Similar questions about resource identity are posed by the emergence of ubiqui­
tous or pervasive computing, in which information processing capability and
connectivity are embedded into physical objects, in devices like smart phones,
and in the surrounding environment. Equipped with sensors, radio-frequency
identification (RFID) tags, GPS data, and user-contributed metadata, these
smart things create a jumbled torrent of information about location and other
properties that must be sorted into identified streams and then matched or as­
sociated with the original resource.
§4.3 Resource Identity (page 182) discusses the issues and methods for deter­
mining “what is a resource?” for physical resources, as well as for the biblio­
graphic resources, information components and smart things discussed here, in
§4.1.1.1 Resources with Parts (page 163).

4.1.2 Identity, Identifiers, and Names
The answer to the question posed in §4.1.1 What Is a Resource? (page 162) has
two parts.
• The first part is identity: what thing are we treating as the resource?
• The second part is identification: differentiating between this single re­
source and other resources like it.
These problems are closely related. Once you have decided what to treat as a
resource, you create a name or an identifier so that you can refer to it reliably. A
name is a label for a resource that is used to distinguish one from another. An
identifier is a special kind of name assigned in a controlled manner and gov­
erned by rules that define possible values and naming conventions. For a digital
resource, its identifier serves as the input to the system or function that deter­
mines its location so it can be retrieved, a process called resolving the identifier
or resolution.
Choosing names and identifiers—be it for a person, a service, a place, a trend, a
work, a document, a concept, etc.—is often challenging and highly contentious.
Naming is made difficult by countless factors, including the audience that will
need to access, share, and use the names, the limitations of language, institu­
tional politics, and personal and cultural biases.

4.1 Introduction

165

The Discipline of Organizing

A common complication arises when a resource has more than one name or
identifier. When something has more than one name each of the multiple names
is a synonym or alias. A particular physical instance of a book might be called a
hardcover or paperback or simply a text. George Furnas and his research col­
laborators called this issue of multiple names for the same resource or concept
the vocabulary problem.163[CogSci]
Whether we call it a book or a text, the resource will usually have a Library of
Congress catalog number as well as an ISBN as an identifier. When the book is
in a carton of books being shipped from the publisher to a bookstore or library,
that carton will have a bar-coded tracking number assigned by the delivery
service, and a manifest or receipt document created by the publisher whose
identifier associates the shipment with the customer. Each of these identifiers is
unique with respect to some established scope or context.
A partial solution to the vocabulary problem is to use a controlled vocabulary.
We can impose rules that standardize the way in which names and labels for re­
sources are assigned in the first place. Alternatively, we can define mappings
from terms used in our natural language to the authoritative or controlled
terms. However, vocabulary control cannot remove all ambiguity. Even if a pass­
port or national identity system requires authoritative full names rather than
nicknames, there could easily be more than one Robert John Smith in the sys­
tem.
Controlling the language used for a particular purpose raises other questions:
Who writes and enforces these rules? What happens when organizing systems
that follow different rules get compared, combined, or otherwise brought to­
gether in contexts different from those for which they were originally intended?

4.2 Four Distinctions about Resources
The nature of the resource is critical for the creation and maintenance of quality
organizing systems. There are four distinctions we make in discussing resour­
ces: domain, format, agency, and focus. Figure 4.1, Resource Domain, Format,
Focus and Agency. depicts these four distinctions, perspectives or points of view
on resources; because they are not independent, we cannot portray these dis­
tinctions as categories of resources.

166

Chapter 4 — Resources in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

Figure 4.1. Resource Domain, Format, Focus and Agency.

Four distinctions we can make when discussing resources concern their domain
(their type of matter or content), format (physical or digital), agency (active or
passive), and focus (primary or description).

4.2.1 Resource Domain
Resource domain is an intuitive notion that groups resources according to the
set of natural or intuitive characteristics that distinguishes them from other re­
sources. It contrasts with the idea of ad hoc or arbitrary groupings of resources
that happen to be in the same place at some time.
For physical resources, domains can be coarsely distinguished according to the
type of matter they are made of using easily perceived properties. The top-level
classification of all things into the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms by
Carl Linnaeus in 1735 is deeply embedded in most languages and cultures to
create a hierarchical system of domain categories. 164[Phil] Many aspects of this
system of domain categories are determined by natural constraints on category
membership that exist as patterns of shared and correlated properties; a re­
source identified as a member of one category must also be a member of anoth­
er with which it shares some but not all properties. For example, a marble stat­
ue in a museum must also be a kind of material, and a fish in an aquarium must
also be a kind of animal.

4.2 Four Distinctions about Resources

167

The Discipline of Organizing

The Document Type Spectrum
Different domains or types of documents can be distinguished according to
the extent to which their content is semantically prescribed, by the amount
of internal structure, and by the correlations of their presentation and for­
matting to their content and structure. These three characteristics of con­
tent, structure, and presentation vary systematically from narrative docu­
ment types like novels to transactional document types like invoices.
Narrative types are authored by people and are heterogeneous in structure
and content, and their content is usually just prose and graphic elements.
Their presentational characteristics carefully reinforce their structure and
semantics; for example, the text of titles or major headings is large because
the content is important, in contrast to the small text of footnotes. Transac­
tional document types are usually created mechanically and, as a result, are
homogeneous in structure and content; their content is largely “data” —
strongly typed content with precise semantics that can be processed by
computers.
In the middle of the spectrum are hybrid document types like textbooks, en­
cyclopedias, and technical manuals that contain a mixture of narrative text
and structured content in figures, data tables, code examples, and so on.
For information resources, easily perceived properties like a book's color or size
are less reliably correlated with resource domain, so we more often distinguish
domains based on semantic properties; the definitions of the “encyclopedia,”
“novel,” and “invoice” resource types distinguish them according to their typical
subject matter, or the type of content, rather than according to the great variety
of physical forms in which we might encounter them. Arranging books by color
or size might be sensible for very small collections, or in a photo studio, but or­
ganizing according to physical properties would make it extremely impractical
to find books in a large library.
We can arrange types of information resources in a hierarchy. However, because
the category boundaries are not sharp it is more useful to view domains of infor­
mation resources on a continuum from weakly-structured narrative content to
highly structured transactional content. This framework, called the Document
Type Spectrum by Glushko and McGrath, captures the idea that the boundaries
between resource domains, like those between colors in the rainbow, are easy to
see for colors far apart in the spectrum but hard to see for adjacent ones.165[Com]
(See the sidebar, The Document Type Spectrum (page 168), and its correspond­
ing depiction as Figure 4.2, Document Type Spectrum.)

Figure 4.2. Document Type Spectrum.

The Document Type Spectrum is a continuum of document types from narrative
ones that are mostly text, like novels, to transactional ones with highlystructured information, like invoices. In between are hybrid types that contain
both narrative and transactional content, like dictionaries and encyclopedias.

4.2.2 Resource Format
Information resources can exist in numerous formats with the most basic dis­
tinction between physical and digital ones. This distinction is most important in
the implementation of a resource storage or preservation system because that is
where physical properties are usually considerations, and very possibly con­
straints. This distinction is less important at the logical level when we design in­
teractions with resources because digital surrogates for the physical resources
can overcome the constraints posed by physical properties. When we search for
cars or appliances in an online store it does not matter where the actual cars or
appliances are located or how they are organized. (See the sidebar, The Three
Tiers of Organizing Systems (page 47)).
Many digital representations can be associated with either physical or digital
resources, but it is important to know which one is the original or primary re­
source, especially for unique or valuable ones.
Today many resources in organizing systems are born digital, created in word
processors, digital cameras, audio and video recorders. Other digital resources
are by sensors in “smart things” and by the systems that create digital resour­
ces when they interact with barcodes, QR codes, RFID tags, or other mecha­
nisms for tracking identity and location.166[Com]
Other digital resources are created by digitization, the process for transforming
an artifact whose original format is physical so it can be stored and manipulated
by a computer. We digitize the printed word, photographs, blueprints, and re­
cord albums. Printed text, for example, can be digitized by scanning pages and
using character recognition software or simply re-typing it.

4.2 Four Distinctions about Resources

169

The Discipline of Organizing

There are a vast number of digital formats that differ in many ways, but we can
coarsely compare them on two dimensions: the degree to which they distinguish
information content from presentation or rendering, and the explicitness with
which content distinctions are represented. Taken together, these two dimen­
sions allow us to compare formats on their overall “Information IQ” —with the
overarching principle being that “smarter” formats contain more computerprocessable information, as illustrated in Figure 4.3, Information IQ.
Simple digital formats for “plain text” documents contain only the characters
that you see on your computer keyboard. ASCII is the most commonly used sim­
ple format, but ASCII is inadequate for most languages, which have larger char­
acter sets, and it also cannot handle mathematical characters.168[Com] The Uni­
code standard was designed to overcome these limitations.169[Com] (ASCII and
Unicode are discussed in great detail in §9.3.1 Notations (page 462).)
Most document formats also explicitly encode a hierarchy of structural compo­
nents, such as chapters, sections or semantic components like descriptions or
procedural steps, and sometimes the appearance of the rendered or printed
form.170[Com] Another important distinction to note is whether the information is
encoded as a sequence of text characters so that it is human readable as well as
computer readable. Encoding character content with XML, for example, allows
for layering of intentional coding or markup interwoven with the “plain text”
content. Because XML processors are required to support Unicode, any charac­
ter can appear in an XML document. The most complex digital formats are
those for multimedia resources and multidimensional data, where the data for­
mat is highly optimized for specialized analysis or applications.171[Com]
Digitization of non-text resources such as film photography, drawings, and ana­
log audio and visual recordings raises a complicated set of choices about pixel
density, color depth, sampling rate, frequency filtering, compression, and nu­
merous other technical issues that determine the digital representation.172[Com]
There may be multiple intended uses and devices for a digitized resource that
could require different digitization approaches and formats. Downstream users
of digitized resources need to know the format in which a digital artifact has
been created, so they can reuse it as is, or process it in other ways.
Some digital formats support interactions that are qualitatively different and
more powerful than those possible with physical resources. Museums are using
virtual world technology to create interactive exhibits in which visitors can fly
through the solar system, scan their own bodies, and change gravity so they can
bounce off walls. Sophisticated digital document formats can enable interac­
tions with annotated digital images or video, 3-D graphics or embedded data­
sets. The Google Art Project contains extremely high resolution photographs of
famous paintings that make it possible to see details that are undetectable un­
der the normal viewing conditions in museums.

Nevertheless, digital representations of physical resources can also lose impor­
tant information and capabilities. The distinctive sounds of hip hop music pro­
duced by “scratching” vinyl records on turntables cannot be produced from dig­
ital MP3 music files.174[Com]

Figure 4.3. Information IQ.

The notion of Information IQ captures the idea that document formats differ on
two dimensions: the explicitness of content representation, and the separation
of content and presentation. A scanned document is just a picture of a document
with neither of these distinctions, so it is low on both dimensions. A database or
XML document distinguishes explicitly between types of content and presenta­
tion is separately assigned, so they are high on both dimensions and have the
highest Information IQ. An HTML document's content distinctions are usually
presentational and, thus, it has lower IQ. Formats with high Information IQ facil­
itate computer processing.

4.2 Four Distinctions about Resources

171

The Discipline of Organizing

Copyright often presents a barrier to digitization, both as a matter of law and
because digitization itself enables copyright enforcement to a degree not possi­
ble prior to the advent of digitization, by eliminating common forms of access
and interactions that are inherently possible with physical printed books like the
ability to give or sell them to someone else.175[Law]

4.2.3 Resource Agency
People as Resources
Earlier editions of this book sidestepped the question of people as resources
to avoid complicating the Discipline of Organizing. People organize them­
selves in innumerable ways to coexist, share knowledge, and accomplish
more than they could as individuals, and behaviors such as trust and reci­
procity might be considered “organizing principles” for human society. But
these organic relationships and interactions usually lack the intentional ar­
rangement to be considered true Organizing Systems, except when the peo­
ple are living in “intentional communities.”9 [Phil]
However, people do qualify as resources in Organizing Systems under our
definition: just like digital and physical resources, human resources can be
identified, categorized, described in terms of their attributes and relation­
ships, and take part in interactions to create value. In businesses, people
are organized to amplify their skills, knowledge, and agency. A company’s
organizational chart is often a formal hierarchy in which each worker’s role
is defined through his or her responsibilities and relationships to others in
the company. Treating an employee abstractly as a resource with specific
and predictable functions, inputs, and outputs enables employees or pro­
cesses to depend upon each other without being distracted by the details of
one another’s work. This so-called “black boxing” can encourage specializa­
tion and allow an organization to function more efficiently.
Nevertheless, while organizational charts are typically presented as neat hi­
erarchies, human relationships cut across the hierarchy to create a net­
work, and may be complicated by differing values and motivations. Conflict­
ing incentives and lack of communication between people may cause break­
downs in the system. People are more than the sum of properties used to or­
ganize them: understanding and defining employees’ roles too narrowly
could exclude the aspects of the job that they find rewarding or consider
part of their professional identity, while black boxing people’s labor and
treating them as “remote person calls” also risks dehumanizing them and
ignoring their working conditions.
Agency is the extent to which a resource can initiate actions on its own. We can
define a continuum between completely passive resources that cannot initiate
172

Chapter 4 — Resources in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

any actions and active resources that can initiate actions based on information
they sense from their environments or obtain through interactions with other
resources. A book being read at the beach will grow warm from absorbing the
sun’s energy but it has no way of measuring its temperature and is a completely
passive resource. An ordinary mercury thermometer senses and displays the
temperature but is not capable of communicating its own reading, whereas a
digital wireless thermometer or weather station can.
Passive resources serve as nouns or operands that are acted upon, while active
resources serve as verbs or operants that cause and carry out actions. We need
a concept of agency to bring resources that are active information sources, or
computational in character, into the organizing system framework. This concept
also lets us include living resources, or more specifically, humans, into discus­
sions about organizing systems in a more general way that emphasizes their
agency.176[Bus]

4.2.3.1 Passive or Operand Resources
Organizing systems that contain passive or operand resources are ubiquitous
for the simple reason that we live in a world of physical resources that we iden­
tify and name in order to interact with them. Passive resources are usually tan­
gible and static and thus they become valuable only as a result of some action
or interaction with them.
Most organizing systems with physical resources or those that contain resour­
ces that are digitized equivalents treat those resources as passive. A printed
book on a library shelf, a digital book in an ebook reader, a statue in a museum
gallery, or a case of beer in a supermarket refrigerator only create value when
they are checked out, viewed, or consumed. None of these resources exhibits
any agency and cannot initiate any actions to create value on their own.

4.2.3.2 Active or Operant Resources
Active resources create effects or value on their own, sometimes when they ini­
tiate interactions with passive resources. Active resources can be people, other
living resources, computational agents, active information sources, web-based
services, self-driving cars, robots, appliances, machines or otherwise ordinary
objects like light bulbs, umbrellas, and shoes that have been made “smarter.”
We can exploit computing capability, storage capacity, and communication band­
width to create active resources that can do things and support interactions
that are impossible for ordinary physical passive resources.
We can analyze active resources according to five capabilities that progressively
increase their agency. These capabilities build on each other to give resources
and the organizing systems in which they participate more ways to create value
through interactions and information exchanges.

These two screenshots of the Nest
iPad app show the thermostat control
panel and an energy history report
with a pop-up note explaining that re­
setting the temperature resulted in
higher than average energy use on
that day. The Nest thermostat serves
as a hub device, communicating with
lights, appliances, smoke alarms,
your car, your wearable fitness sen­
sor, and other active resources
(https://nest.com/works-with-nest/).

Sensing or awareness
The minimal capability for a resource
to have some agency is for it to be
able to sense or be aware of some as­
pect of its environment or its interac­
tions with other resources. A ther­
mometer measures temperature, a
photodetector measures light, a
gauge measures the fuel left in a car’s
gas tank, a GPS device computes its
location after detecting and analyzing
signals from satellites, a wearable fit­
ness sensor tracks your heartbeat and
how far you walk. But sensing some­
thing in itself does not create any val­
ue in an organizing system. Some­
thing needs to be done.
Actuation
A resource has the capability to ac­
tuate when it can create effects or
value by initiating some action as a
result of the information it senses;
“actuator” is often used to describe a
resource that can move or control a
physical mechanism or system, while
“effector” is used when the resource
is a biological one. Resources can ac­
tuate by turning on lights, speakers,
cameras, motors, switches, by send­
ing a message about the state or val­
ue of a sensor, or by moving them­
selves around (as with robots).
A potential or latent actuation is cre­
ated when a resource can display or
broadcast some aspect of its state,
but value is only created if another re­
source (possibly human) happens to
see the display or hear the broadcast
and then acts upon it.

For example, RFID chips, which are essentially bar codes with built-in radio
transponders, can be attached to otherwise passive resources to make them
active. RFID chips begin transmitting when they detect the presence of a
174

Chapter 4 — Resources in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

RFID reading device. This enables automated location tracking and context
sensing. RFID receivers are built into assembly lines, loading docks, parking
lots, toll booths, or store shelves to detect when some RFID-tagged resource
is at some meaningful location. RFID tags can be made more useful by hav­
ing them record and transmit information from sensors that detect tempera­
ture, humidity, acceleration, and even biological contamination.177[DS]
Connectivity
For an active resource to do useful work it must be connected in some way
to the actuation mechanism that manipulates or controls some other re­
source. This connection might be a direct and permanent one between the
resource and the thing it actuates, like that of a thermostat whose tempera­
ture sensing capability has a fixed connection to a heating or cooling system
that it turns off or on depending on the temperature.
An important innovation in the design of active resources is “wrapping”
physical resources with software so they can be given IP addresses and
make connections with Internet protocols, which allows them to send infor­
mation to an application with more capability to act on it. Such resources
are said to be part of the “Internet of Things.”
Smart phones are active resources that can identify and share their own lo­
cation, orientation, acceleration and a growing number of other contextual
parameters to enable personalization of information services. Smart phones
can also run the applications that receive messages from and send messages
to other smart resources to monitor and optimize how they work.
Computation or programmability
Simple active resources operate in a deterministic manner: given this sensor
reading, do this. Other active resources have computational capabilities that
enable them to analyze the current and historical information from their sen­
sors, identify significant data values or patterns in these interaction resour­
ces, and then adapt their behavior accordingly.
Many thermostats are programmable, but most people do not bother to pro­
gram them so they miss out on potential energy savings. Nest Labs makes a
learning thermostat that programs itself. The Nest thermostat uses sensors
for temperature, humidity, motion, and light to figure out whether people

phone. A new generation of robots typified by one called Baxter can be
trained by example; a person moves Baxter's arms and hands to show him

Composability and cooperating
The “smartest” active resources can do more than analyze the information
they collect and adapt what they do. In addition, they expose what they
know and can do to other resources using standard or non-proprietary for­
mats and protocols. This means that active resources that were independ­
ently designed and implemented can work together to create value.
Many organizing systems on the web consist of collections or configurations
of active digital resources. Interactions among these active resources often
implement information-intensive business models where value is created by
exchanging, manipulating, transforming, or otherwise processing informa­
tion, rather than by manipulating, transforming, or otherwise processing
physical resources.
We are beginning to see the same principles of modularity and composability
applied to physical resources, with open source software libraries for using
sensors and micro-controllers and easy to use APIs. In essence, we are using
software and physical resources in much the same way as functional build­
ing blocks, and standards will be critically important.
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an emerging design discipline for organ­
izing active software resources as functional business components that can be
combined in different ways. SOA is generally implemented using web services
that exchange XML documents in real-time information flows to interconnect
the business service components.
A familiar design pattern for an organizing system composed from active digital
resources is the “online store.” The store can be analyzed as a composition or
choreography in which some web pages display catalog items, others serve as
“shopping carts” to assemble the order, and then a “checkout” page collects the
buyer’s payment and delivery information that gets passed on to other service
providers who process payments and deliver the goods.
Design patterns for composing organizing systems from “smart” physical re­
sources are emerging in work on the “smart home,” “smart office building,” or
“smart city.” Many experiments are underway and new products emerging that
are trying out different combinations of hardware and software to understand
the design tradeoffs between them to best determine where the “smarts” should
go. For example, we can compare a “smart home” built around a superintelligent hub device that communicates and coordinates with many other “not
so smart” devices from the same manufacturer to one in which all of the devices
are equally smart and come from different makers.

At more complex scales, a truly smart
building will not just have program­
mable thermostats to control heating
and cooling systems. It will take in
weather forecasts, travel calendars,
information about the cost of electric­
ity from different sources, and other
relevant information as inputs to a
model of how the building heats and
cools to optimize energy use and cost
while keeping the rooms at appropri­
ate temperatures.
Standard application interfaces ena­
ble active resources to interact with
people to get information that might
otherwise come from sensors or that
enhances the value of the sensor in­
formation. A programmable thermo­
stat that can record time-based pref­
erences of the people who use the
space controlled by the thermostat is
more capable than one with just a sin­
gle temperature threshold. A stand­
ard Internet protocol for communicat­
ing with the thermostat would enable
it to be controlled remotely.

IFTTT is a visual programming sys­
tem that lets non-programmers con­
nect and control active resources in
the physical and digital worlds.
IFTTT programs, called recipes, can
take information from a growing li­
brary of Internet services (date/
time, calendar, weather, news,
email, social media, and many oth­
ers) and use this information with
simple control logic to trigger ac­
tions in other services or resources.
Example recipes can copy an Insta­
gram photo to Google Drive, add
daily Fitbit data to a spreadsheet,
or control lights based on time,
weather, or sunset.

Open and standard data formats and
communication protocols enable the

aggregation and analysis of informa­
tion from many instances of the same type of active resource. For example,
smart phones running the Google Maps application transmit information about
their speed and location. Machine learning and sophisticated optimization tech­
niques of this dataset can yield collective intelligence that can then be given to
the resources from which it was derived. In this case, Google can identify traffic
jams and generate alternative routes for the drivers stuck in traffic.
But not everything can be done best by computers. The web has enabled the use
of people as active resources to carry out tasks of short duration that can be
precisely described but which cannot be done reliably by computers. These
tasks often require aesthetic or subjective judgment. The people doing these
web-based tasks are often called “Mechanical Turks” by analogy to a fake chess
playing machine from the 18th century that had a human hidden inside who se­
cretly moved the pieces.178[Web]

Stop and Think: The Internet
of Things
There is a great deal of hype about
the Internet of Things, but there is
also a great deal of innovation. If
you search for the phrase “Internet
of Things” along with almost any
physical resource, chances are you
will find something, Try “baby,”
“dog,” “fork,” “lettuce,” “pajamas,”
“streetlamp,” and then a few of
your own.

4.2.4 Resource Focus
A fourth contrast between types of re­
sources distinguishes original or pri­
mary resources from resources that
describe them. Any primary resource
can have one or more description re­
sources associated with it to facilitate
finding, interacting with, or interpret­
ing the primary one. Description re­
sources are essential in organizing
systems where the primary resources
are not under its control and can only
be accessed or interacted with
through the description. Description

resources are often called metadata.
The distinction between primary resources and description resources, or meta­
data, is deeply embedded in library science and traditional organizing systems
whose collections are predominantly text resources like books, articles, or other
documents. In these contexts description resources are commonly called biblio­
graphic resources or catalogs, and each primary resource is typically associated
with one or more description resources.
In business enterprises, the organizing systems for digital information resour­
ces, such as business documents, or data records created by transactions or au­
tomated processes, almost always employ resources that describe, or are associ­
ated with, large sets or classes of primary resources.179[Com]
The contrast between primary resources and description resources is very use­
ful in many contexts, but when we look more broadly at organizing systems, it is
often difficult to distinguish them, and determining which resources are primary
and which are metadata is often just a decision about which resource is current­
ly the focus of our attention.180[Law]
For example, many Twitter users treat the 140-character message body as the
primary resource, while the associated metadata about the message and sender
(is it a forward, reply, link, etc.) is less important. However, for firms that use
Twitter metadata to measure sender and brand impact, or identify social net­
works and trends, the focus is the metadata, not the content.181[DS]
As another example, players on professional sports teams are human resources,
but millions of people participate in fantasy sports leagues where teams consist
of resources based on the statistics generated by the actual human players. Put
another way, the associated resources in the actual sports are treated as the pri­
mary ones in the fantasy leagues.182[Bus]

4.2.5 Resource Format x Focus
Applying the format contrast between physical and digital resources to the fo­
cus distinction between primary and descriptive resources yields a useful frame­
work with four categories of resources (Figure 4.4, Resource Format x Focus.).

Figure 4.4. Resource Format x Focus.

The distinctions of resource format and resource focus combine to distinguish
four categories of resources: physical resources, digital resources, physical de­
scriptions , and digital descriptions.

4.2.5.1 Physical Description of a Primary Physical Resource
The oldest relationship between descriptive resources and physical resources is
when descriptions or other information about physical resources are themselves
encoded in a physical form. Nearly ten thousand years ago in Mesopotamia
small clay tokens kept in clay containers served as inventory information to
count units of goods or livestock. It took 5000 years for the idea of stored to­
kens to evolve into Cuneiform writing in which marks in clay stood for the to­
kens and made both the tokens and containers unnecessary.

nian, Persian, and Assyrian artifacts that are nearly three thousand years
old. including numerous cuneiform clay tablets like this one.

Printed cards served as physical description resources for books in libraries for
nearly two centuries.

4.2.5.2 Digital Description of a Primary Physical Resource
Here, the digital resource describes a physical resource. The most familiar ex­
ample of this relationship is the online library catalog used to find the shelf loca­
tion of physical library resources, which beginning in the 1960s replaced the
physical cards with database records. The online catalogs for museums usually
contain a digital photograph of the painting, item of sculpture, or other museum
object that each catalog entry describes.

Bar Code Shopping in A

Digital description resources for pri­
mary physical resources are essential
in supply chain management, logistics
retailing, transportation, and every
business model that depends on hav­
ing timely and accurate information
about where things are or about their
current states. This digital description
resource is created as a result of an
interaction with a primary physical
resource like a temperature sensor or
with some secondary physical re­
source that is already associated with
the primary physical resource like an
RFID tag or barcode.

Augmented reality systems combine a
layer of real-time digital information

Augmented reality displays have recently been incorporated into wearable tech­
nology like Google Glass, which mounts on eyeglass frames to display informa­
tion obtained from the Internet after being requested by voice commands. Some
luxury car brands have incorporated similar technology to project dashboard
data, traffic conditions, and directions on the driver's windshield.

4.2.5.3 Digital Description of a Primary Digital Resource
A digital resource describes a digital resource. This is the relationship in a digi­
tal library or any web-based organizing system, making it possible to access a
primary digital resource directly from the digital secondary resource.

4.2.5.4 Physical Description of a Primary Digital Resource
This is the relationship implemented when we encounter an embedded QR bar­
code in newspaper or magazine advertisements, on billboards, sidewalks, tshirts, or on store shelves. Scanning the QR code with a mobile phone camera
can launch a website that contains information about a product or service, place
an order for one unit of the pointed-to- item in a web catalog, dial a phone num­
ber, or initiate another application or service identified by the QR code.

4.3 Resource Identity
Determining the identity of resources that belong in a domain, deciding which
properties are important or relevant to the people or systems operating in that
domain, and then specifying the principles by which those properties encapsu­
late or define the relationships among the resources are the essential tasks
when building any organizing system. In organizing systems used by individuals
or with small scope, the methods for doing these tasks are often ad hoc and un­
systematic, and the organizing systems are therefore idiosyncratic and do not
scale well. At the other extreme, organizing systems designed for institutional
or industry-wide use, especially in information-intensive domains, require sys­
tematic design methods to determine which resources will have separate identi­
ties and how they are related to each other. These resources and their relation­
ships are then described in conceptual models which guide the implementation
of the systems that manage the resources and support interactions with
them.186[Com]

4.3.1 Identity and Physical Resources
Our human visual and cognitive systems do a remarkable job at picking out ob­
jects from their backgrounds and distinguishing them from each other. In fact,
we have little difficulty recognizing an object or a person even if we are seeing
them from a novel distance and viewing angle or with different lighting, shad­
ing, and so on. When we watch a football game, we do not have any trouble per­
ceiving the players moving around the field, and their contrasting uniform col­
ors allow us to see that there are two different teams.
The perceptual mechanisms that make us see things as permanent objects with
contrasting visible properties are just the prerequisite for the organizing tasks
of identifying the specific object, determining the categories of objects to which
it belongs, and deciding which of those categories is appropriate to emphasize.
Most of the time we carry out these tasks in an automatic, unconscious way; at
other times we make conscious decisions about them. For some purposes we
consider a sports team as a single resource, as a collection of separate players
for others, as offense and defense, as starters and reserves, and so on.187[CogSci]
Although we have many choices about how we can organize football players, all
of them will include the concept of a single player as the smallest identifiable
resource. We are never going to think of a football player as an intentional col­
lection of separately identified leg, arm, head, and body resources because
there are no other ways to “assemble” a human from body parts. Put more gen­
erally, there are some natural constraints on the organization of matter into
parts or collections based on sizes, shapes, materials, and other properties that
make us identify some things as indivisible resources in some domain.

4.3.2 Identity and Bibliographic Resources
Pondering the question of identity is something relatively recent in the world of
librarians and catalogers. Libraries have been around for about 4000 years, but
until the last few hundred years librarians created “bins” of headings and topics
to organize resources without bothering to give each individual item a separate
identifier or name. This meant searchers first had to make an educated guess as
to which bin might house their desired information—“Histories”? “Medical and
Chemical Philosophy”?—then scour everything in the category in a quest for
their desired item. The choices were ad hoc and always local—that is, each cata­
loger decided the bins and groupings for each catalog.
The distinctions put forth by Panizzi, Lubetzky, Svenonius and other library sci­
ence theorists have evolved today into a four-step abstraction hierarchy (see
Figure 4.5, The FRBR Abstraction Hierarchy.) between the abstract work, an ex­
pression in multiple formats or genres, a particular manifestation in one of
those formats or genres, and a specific physical item.

If we revisit the question “What is this thing we call Macbeth?” we can see how
different ways of answering fit into this abstraction hierarchy. The most specific
answer is that “ Macbeth” is a specific item, a very particular and individual re­
source, like that dog-eared paperback with yellow marked pages that you
owned when you read Macbeth in high school. A more abstract answer is that
Macbeth is an idealization called a work, a category that includes all the plays,
movies, ballets, or other intellectual creations that share a recognizable amount
of the plot and meaning from the original Shakespeare play.

The abstraction hierarchy for identifying resources yields four different answers
about the identity of an information resource.

Chapter 4 — Resources in Organizing Systems

4.3.3 Identity and Information Components
In information-intensive domains, documents, databases, software applications,
or other explicit repositories or sources of information are ubiquitous and es­
sential to the creation of value for the user, reader, consumer, or customer. Val­
ue is created through the comparison, compilation, coordination or transforma­
tion of information in some chain or choreography of processes operating on in­
formation flowing from one information source or process to another. These pro­
cesses are employed in accounting, financial services, procurement, logistics,
supply chain management, insurance underwriting and claims processing, legal
and professional services, customer support, computer programming, and ener­
gy management.
The processes that create value in information-intensive domains are “glued to­
gether” by shared information components that are exchanged in documents,
records, messages, or resource descriptions of some kind. Information compo­
nents are the primitive and abstract resources in information-intensive domains.
They are the units of meaning that serve as building blocks of composite de­
scriptions and other information artifacts.
The value creation processes in information-intensive domains work best when
their component parts come from a common controlled vocabulary for compo­
nents, or when each uses a vocabulary with a granularity and semantic preci­
sion compatible with the others. For example, the value created by a personal
health record emerges when information from doctors, clinics, hospitals, and in­
surance companies can be combined because they all share the same “patient”
component as a logical piece of information.
This abstract definition of information components does not help identify them,
so we will introduce some heuristic criteria: An information component can be:
(1) Any piece of information that has a unique label or identifier or (2) Any piece
of information that is self-contained and comprehensible on its own.192[Com]
These two criteria for determining the identity of information components are
often easy to satisfy through observations, interviews, and task analysis because
people naturally use many different types of information and talk easily about
specific components and the documents that contain them. Some common com­
ponents (e.g., person, location, date, item) and familiar document types (e.g., re­
port, catalog, calendar, receipt) can be identified in almost any domain. Other
components need to be more precisely defined to meet the more specific seman­
tic requirements of narrower domains. These smaller or more fine-grained com­
ponents might be viewed as refined or qualified versions of the generic compo­
nents and document types, like course grade and semester components in aca­
demic transcripts, airport codes and flight numbers in travel itineraries and
tickets, and drug names and dosages in prescriptions.
4.3 Resource Identity

185

The Discipline of Organizing

Decades of practical and theoretical effort in conceptual modeling, relational
theory, and database design have resulted in rigorous methods for identifying
information components when requirements and business rules for information
can be precisely specified. For example, in the domain of business transactions,
required information like item numbers, quantities, prices, payment informa­
tion, and so on must be encoded as a particular type of data—integer, decimal,
Unicode string, etc.— with clearly defined possible values and that follows clear
occurrence rules.193[Com]
Identifying components can seem superficially easy at the transactional end of
the Document Type Spectrum (see the sidebar in §4.2.1 Resource Domain (page
167)), with orders or invoices, forms requiring data entry, or other highlystructured document types like product catalogs, where pieces of information
are typically labeled and delimited by boxes, lines, white space or other presen­
tation features that encode the distinctions between types of content. For exam­
ple, the presence of ITEM, CUSTOMER NAME, ADDRESS, and PAYMENT IN­
FORMATION labels on the fields of an online order form suggests these pieces
of information are semantically distinct components in a retail application. In
addition, these labels might have analogues in variable names in the source
code that implements the order form, or as tags in a XML document created by
the ordering application; <CustName>John Smith</CustName> and <Item>A-19</
Item> in the order document can be easily identified when it is sent to the other
services by the order management application.
But the theoretically grounded methods for identifying components like those of
relational theory and normalization that work for structured data do not strictly
apply when information requirements are more qualitative and less precise at
the narrative end of the Document Type Spectrum. These information require­
ments are typical of narrative, unstructured and semi-structured types of docu­
ments, and information sources like those often found in law, education, and
professional services. Narrative documents include technical publications, re­
ports, policies, procedures and other less structured information, where seman­
tic components are rarely labeled explicitly and are often surrounded by text
that is more generic. Unlike transactional documents that depend on precise se­
mantics because they are used by computers, narrative documents are used by
people, who can ask if they are not sure what something means, so there is less
need to explicitly define the meaning of the information components. Occasional
exceptions, such as where components in narrative documents are identified
with explicit labels like NOTE and WARNING, only prove the rule.

4.3.4 Identity and Active Resources
Active resources (§4.4.3.2) initiate effects or create value on their own. In many
cases an inherently passive physical resource like a product package or ship­
ping pallet is transformed into an active one when associated with an RFID tag
or bar code. Mobile phones contain device or subscriber IDs so that any infor­
mation they communicate can be associated both with the phone and often,
through indirect reference, with a particular person. If the resource has an IP
address, it is said to be part of the “Internet of Things.”194[Com]
Organizing systems that create value from active resources often co-exist with
or complement organizing systems that treat its resources as passive. In a tradi­
tional library, books sat passively on shelves and required users to read their
spines to identify them. Today, some library books contain active RFID tags that
make them dynamic information sources that self-identify by publishing their
own locations. Similarly, a supermarket or department store might organize its
goods as physical resources on shelves, treating them as passive resources; su­
perimposed on that traditional organizing system is one that uses point-of-sale
transaction information created when items are scanned at checkout counters
to automatically re-order goods and replenish the inventory at the store where
they were sold. In some stores the shelves contain sensors that continually “talk
to the goods” and the information they gather can maintain inventory levels and
even help prevent theft of valuable merchandise by tracking goods through a
store or warehouse. The inventory becomes a collection of active resources;
each item eager to announce its own location and ready to conduct its own sale.
Another category of inanimate objects that are active resources are those that
use Twitter to communicate their status or sensor measurements. These include
bridges, rivers, and the Curiosity Rover on Mars.
The extent to which an active resource is “smart” depends on how much com­
puting capability it has available to refine the data it collects and communi­
cates. A large collection of sensors can transmit a torrent of captured data that
requires substantial processing to distinguish significant events from those that
reflect normal operation, and also from those that are statistical outliers with
strange values caused by random noise. This challenge gets qualitatively more
difficult as the amount of data grows to big data size, because a one in million
event might be a statistical outlier that can be ignored, but if there are a thou­
sand similar outliers in a billion sensor readings, this cluster of data probably
reveals something important. On the other hand, giving every sensor the com­
puting capability to refine its data so that it only communicates significant infor­
mation might make the sensors too expensive to deploy.195[DS]

4.4 Naming Resources
Determining the identity of the thing,
document, information component, or
data item we need is not always
enough. We often need to give that re­
source a name, a label that will help
us understand and talk about what it
is. But naming is not just the simple
task of assigning a sequence of char­
acters. In this section, we will discuss
why we name, some of the problems
with naming, and the principles that
help us name things in useful ways.

4.4.1 What’s in a Name?

When a child is born, its parents give
it a name, often a very stressful and
contentious decision. Names serve to
distinguish one person from another,
although names might not be unique
—there are thousands of people named James Smith and Maria Garcia. Names
also, intentionally or unintentionally, suggest characteristics or aspirations. The
name given to us at birth is just one of the names we will be identified with dur­
ing our lifetimes. We have nicknames, names we use professionally, names we
use with friends, and names we use online. Our banks, our schools, and our gov­
ernments will know who we are because of numbers they associate with our
names. As long as it serves its purpose to identify you, your name could be any­
thing.196[Law]
Resources other than people need names so we can find them, describe them,
reuse them, refer or link to them, record who owns them, and otherwise inter­
act with them. In many domains the names assigned to resources are also influ­
enced or constrained by rules, industry practice, or technology considerations.

4.4.2 The Problems of Naming
Giving names to anything, from a business to a concept to an action, can be a
difficult process and it is possible to do it well or do it poorly. The following sec­
tion details some of the major challenges in assigning a name to a resource.

4.4.2.1 The Vocabulary Problem
Every natural language offers more than one way to express any thought, and in
particular there are usually many words that can be used to refer to the same
thing or concept. The words people choose to name or describe things are em­
bodied in their experiences and context, so people will often disagree in the
words they use. Moreover, people are often a bit surprised when it happens, be­
cause what seems like the natural or obvious name to one person is not natural
or obvious to another. One way to avoid surprises is to have people cooperate in
choosing names for resources, and information architects often use participato­
ry design techniques of card sorting or free listing for this purpose.197[Ling] 198[IA]
Back in the 1980s in the early days of computer user interface design, George
Furnas and his colleagues at Bell Labs conducted a set of experiments to meas­
ure how much people would agree when they named some resource or function.
The short answer: very little. Left to our own devices, we come up with a shock­
ingly large number of names for a single common thing.
In one experiment, a thousand pairs of people were asked to “write the name
you would give to a program that tells about interesting activities occurring in
some major metropolitan area.” Less than 12 pairs of people agreed on a name.
Furnas called this phenomenon the vocabulary problem, concluding that no sin­
gle word could ever be considered the “best” name.199[CogSci]

4.4.2.2 Homonymy, Polysemy, and False Cognates
Sometimes the same word can refer to different resources—a “bank” can be a
financial institution or the side of a river. When two words are spelled the same
but have different meanings they are homographs; if they are also pronounced
the same they are homonyms. If the different meanings of the homographs are
related, they are polysemes.
Resources with homonymous and polysemous names are sometimes incorrectly
identified, especially by an automated process that cannot use common sense or
context to determine the correct referent. Polysemy can cause more trouble
than simple homography because the overlapping meaning might obscure the
misinterpretation. If one person thinks of a “shipping container” as being a
cardboard box and orders some of them, while another person thinks of a “ship­
ping container” as the large box carried by semi-trailers and stacked on cargo
ships, their disagreement might not be discovered until the wrong kinds of con­
tainers arrive.200[CogSci]
Many words in different languages have common roots, and as a result are often
spelled the same or nearly the same. This is especially true for technology
words; for example, “computer” has been borrowed by many languages. The ex­
istence of these cognates and borrowed words makes us vulnerable to false

4.4.2.3 Names with Undesirable Associations
False cognates are a special category of words that make poor names, and there
are many stories relating product marketing mistakes, where a product name or
description translates poorly, into other languages or cultures, with undesirable
associations.201[Ling] Furthermore, these undesirable associations differ across
cultures. For example, even though floor numbers have the straightforward pur­
pose to identify floors from lowest to highest levels, most buildings in Western
cultures skip the 13th floor because many people think 13 is an unlucky number.
In many East and Southeast Asian buildings, the 4th floor is skipped. In China
the number 4 is dreaded because it sounds like the word for “death,” while 8 is
prized because it sounds like the word for “wealth.”
While it can be tempting to dismiss unfamiliar biases and beliefs about names
and identifiers as harmless superstitions and practices, their implications are
ubiquitous and far from benign. Alphabetical ordering might seem like a fair
and non-discriminatory arrangement of resources, but because it is easy to
choose the name at the top of an alphabetical list, many firms in service busi­
nesses select names that begin with “A,” “AA,” or even “AAA” (look in any prin­
ted service directory). A consequence of this bias is that people or resources
with names that begin with letters late in the alphabet are systematically discri­
minated against because they are often not considered, or because they are
evaluated in the context created by resources earlier in the alphabet rather
than on their own merit.202[Bus]

Many resources are given names based on attributes that can be problematic
later if the attribute changes in value or interpretation.
Web resources are often referred to using URLs that contain the domain name
of the server on which the resource is located, followed by the directory path
and file name on the computer running the server. This treats the current loca­
tion of the resource as its name, so the name will change if the resource is
moved. It also means that resources that are identical in content, like those at
an archive or mirror website, will have different names than the original even
though they are exact copies. An analogous problem is faced by restaurants or
businesses with street names or numbers in their names if they lose their leases
or want to expand.203[Bus]

From ‘Kentucky Fried
Chicken’ to ‘KFC’

“Kentucky Fried Chicken” was foun­
ded in 1930 by Harland Sanders as a
tiny restaurant in a gas station store­
room in Corbin, Kentucky. It was one
of the first fast-food chains to go in­
ternational, and in 1987 was the first
Western restaurant chain to open in
China. It changed its name to “KFC”
a few years later, no doubt in part be­
cause in Beijing, Moscow, London and
other locations not anywhere near
Kentucky many people have probably
never heard of the place.

Chapter 4 — Resources in Organizing Systems

Some dynamic web resources that are
generated by programs have URIs
that contain information about the
server technology used to create
them. When the technology changes,
the URIs will no longer work.204[Web]
Some resources have names that in­
clude page numbers, which disappear
or change when the resource is ac­
cessed in a digital form. For example,
the standard citation format for legal
opinions uses the page number from
the printed volume issued by West
Publishing, which has a virtual mo­
nopoly on the publishing of court
opinions and other types of legal
documents.205[Law]
Some resources have names that con­
tain dates, years or other time indica­
tors, most often to point to the future.
The film studio named “20th Century
Fox” took on that name in the 1930s
to give it a progressive, forwardlooking identity, but today a name
with “20th Century” in it does the op­
posite.206[Ling]

4.4.2.5 The Semantic Gap
The semantic gap is the difference in perspective in naming and description
when resources are described by automated processes rather than by peo­
ple.207[Com]
The semantic gap is largest when computer programs or sensors obtain and
name some information in a format optimized for efficient capture, storage, de­
coding, or other technical criteria. The names—like IMG20268.jpg on a digital
photo—might make sense for the camera as it stores consecutively taken photos
but they are not good names for people. We may prefer names that describe the
content of the picture, like GoldenGateBridge.jpg.
When we try to examine the content of computer-created or sensor-captured re­
sources, like a clip of music or a compiled software program, a text rendering of
the content simply looks like nonsense. It was designed to be interpreted by a
computer program, not by a person.

4.4.3 Choosing Good Names and Identifiers
If someone tells you they are having dinner with their best friend, a cousin,
someone with whom they play basketball, and their professional mentor from
work, how many places at the table will be set? Anywhere from two to five; it is
possible all those relational descriptions refer to a single person, or to four dif­
ferent people, and because “friend,” “cousin,” “basketball teammate” and “men­
tor” do not name specific people you will have to guess who is coming to dinner.
If instead of descriptions you are told that the dinner guests are Bob, Carol,
Ted, and Alice, you can count four names and you know how many people are
having dinner. But you still cannot be sure exactly which four people are in­
volved because there are many people with those names.
The uncertainty is eliminated if we use identifiers rather than names. Identifiers
are names that refer unambiguously to a specific person, place, or resource be­
cause they are assigned in a controlled way. Identifiers are often strings of num­
bers or letters rather than words to avoid the biases and associations that words
can convey. For example, a professor might grade exams that are identified by
student numbers rather than names.

Names {and, or, vs} Identifiers
People change their names for many reasons: when they get married or di­
vorced, because their name is often mispronounced or misspelled, to make
a political or ethnic statement, or because they want to stand out. A few
years a football player with a large ego named Chad Johnson, which is the
second most common surname in the US, decided to change his name to his
player number of 85, becoming Chad “Ochocinco.” He had an ochocin­
co.com website and used the ochocinco name on Facebook and Twitter. In a
bit of irony, when Ochocinco wanted to put Ocho Cinco on the back of his
football jersey, the football league would not let him because his legal name
does not have a space in it. That surely contributed to his decision to
change his name back to Chad Johnson in 2012.
When you go to coffee shops, you are often asked your name, which the
cashier writes on the empty cup so that your drink can be identified after
the barista makes it. They do not actually need your name; just as some es­
tablishments use a receipt number to distinguish orders, what they need is
an identifier. So even if your name is Joe, you can tell them it is Thor, Wotan,
Mercurio, El Greco, Clark Kent, or any other name that is likely to be a
unique identifier for the minute it takes to make your beverage.208[Bus]
The distinction between names and identifiers for people is often not appreci­
ated. (See the sidebar, Names {and, or, vs} Identifiers (page 194).)

4.4.3.1 Make Names Informative
The most basic principle of naming is to choose names that are informative,
which makes them easier to understand and remember. It is easier to tell what a
computer program or XML document is doing if it uses names like “ItemCost”
and “TotalCost” rather than just “I” or “T.” People will enter more consistent
and reusable address information if a form asks explicitly for “Street,” “City,”
and “PostalCode” instead of “Line1” and “Line2.”
Identifiers can be designed with internal structure and semantics that conveys
information beyond the basic aspect of pointing to a specific resource. An Inter­
national Standard Book Number (ISBN) like “978-0-262-07261-8” identifies a re­
source (07261=“Document Engineering”) and also reveals that the resource is a
book (978), in English (0), and published by The MIT Press (262).209[Com]
The navigation points that mark intersections of radial signals from ground bea­
cons or satellites that are crucial to aircraft pilots used to be meaningless fiveletter codes that were changed to make them suggest their locations; semantic
landmark names made pilots less likely to enter the wrong names into naviga­
tion systems, For example, some of the navigation points near Orlando, Florida
—the home of Disney World—are MICKI, MINEE, and GOOFY.210[Ling]

4.4.3.2 Use Controlled Vocabularies
One way to encourage good names for a given resource domain or task is to es­
tablish a controlled vocabulary. A controlled vocabulary is like a fixed or closed
dictionary that includes the terms that can be used in a particular domain. A
controlled vocabulary shrinks the number of words used, reducing synonymy
and homonymy, eliminating undesirable associations, leaving behind a set of
words with precisely defined meanings and rules governing their use.
A controlled vocabulary is not simply a set of allowed words; it also includes
their definitions and often specifies rules by which the vocabulary terms can be
used and combined. Different domains can create specific controlled vocabula­
ries for their own purposes, but the important thing is that the vocabulary be
used consistently throughout that domain.
For bibliographic resources important aspects of vocabulary control include de­
termining the authoritative forms for author names, uniform titles of works, and
the set of terms by which a particular subject will be known. In library science,
the process of creating and maintaining these standard names and terms is
known as authority control.
Official authority files are maintained for many resource domains: a gazetteer
associates names and locations and tells us whether we should be referring to
Bombay or Mumbai; the Domain Name System (DNS) maps human-oriented do­

main and host names to their IP addresses; the Chemical Abstracts Service Reg­
istry assigns unique identifiers to every chemical described in the open scientif­
ic literature; numerous institutions assign unique identifiers to different catego­
ries of animal species.
In some cases, authority files are created or maintained by a community, as in
the case of MusicBrainz, an “open music encyclopedia” to which users contrib­
ute information about artists, releases, tracks, and other aspects of music. Mu­
sic metadata is notoriously unreliable; one study found over 100 variations in
the description of the Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door song (written by Bob Dylan)
as recorded by Guns N’ Roses.214[Web]

4.4.3.3 Allow Aliasing

Aliasing: Bad for this Fish

A fish once known as the Patagonian Toothfish because of its large and un­
attractive teeth became popular in American restaurants when a fish whole­
saler began marketing it as the Chilean Sea Bass even though it is usually
found farther south in cold Antarctic waters and it is not a sea bass. Un­
fortunately for the fish, this alias was so successful that it led to overfishing,
threatening the survival of the species. Some environmentally-oriented
chefs, restauranteurs, and seafood distributors organized a boycott to save
the fish. (Fabricant 2002)
(Photo published by the United States Government. Not protectable by
copyright (17 USC Sec. 105).)

A controlled vocabulary is extremely useful to people who use it, but if you are
designing an organizing system for other people who do not or cannot use it,
you need to accommodate the variety of words they will actually use when they
seek or describe resources. The authoritative name of a certain fish species is
Amphiprion ocellaris, but most people would search for it as “clownfish,” “ane­
mone fish,” or even by its more familiar film name of Nemo.

Chapter 4 — Resources in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

Furnas suggests “unlimited aliasing” to connect the uncontrolled or natural vo­
cabularies that people use with the controlled one employed by the organizing
system. By this he means that there must be many alternate access routes to
each word or function that a user is trying to find. For example, the birth name
of the 42nd President of the United States of America is “William Jefferson Clin­
ton,” but web pages that refer to him as “Bill Clinton” are vastly more common,
and searches for the former are redirected to the latter. A related mechanism
used by search engines is spelling correction, essentially treating all the incor­
rect spellings as aliases of the correct one (“did you mean California?” when
you typed “Claifornia”).

4.4.3.4 Make Identifiers Unique or Qualified
Even though an identifier refers to a single resource, this does not mean that no
two identifiers are identical. One military inventory system might use stock
number 99 000 1111 to identify a 24-hour, cold-climate ration pack, while an­
other inventory system could use the same number to identify an electronic ra­
dio valve. Each identifier is unique in its inventory system, but if a supply re­
quest gets sent to the wrong warehouse hungry soldiers could be sent radio
valves instead of rations.215[Law]
We can prevent or reduce identifier collisions by adding information about the
namespace, the domain from which the names or identifiers are selected, thus
creating what are often called qualified names. There are several dozen US cit­
ies named “Springfield” and “Washington,” but adding state codes to mail ad­
dresses distinguishes them. Likewise, we can add prefixes to XML element
names when we create documents that reuse components from multiple docu­
ment types, distinguishing <book:Title> from <legal:Title>.
We can fix problems like these by qualifying or extending the identifier, or by
creating a globally unique identifier (GUID), one that will never be the same as
another identifier in any organizing system anywhere else. One easy method to
create a GUID is to use a URL you control and append a string to it, the same
approach that gives every web page a unique address. GUIDs are often used to
identify software objects, the resources in distributed systems, or data collec­
tions.217[Com]
Because they are not created by an algorithm whose results are provably
unique, we do not consider fingerprints, or other biometric information, to be
globally unique identifiers for people, but for all practical purposes they
are.218[Com]

4.4 Naming Resources

197

The Discipline of Organizing

4.4.3.5 Distinguish Identifying and Resolving
When the identifier does not contain information about resource location, it
must be“resolved” to determine the location. With physical resources, resolu­
tion takes place with the aid of signs, maps, or other associated resources that
describe the resource arrangement in some physical environment; for example,
“You are here” maps associate each resource identifier with a coordinate or oth­
er means of finding it on the map. With digital resources, the resolver is a direc­
tory system or service that interprets an identifier and looks up its location or
directly initiates resource retrieval.

4.5 Resources over Time
Problems of “what is the resource?” and “how do we identify it?” are complex
and often require ongoing work to ensure they are properly answered as an or­
ganizing system evolves. We might need to know how a resource does or does
not change over time (its persistence), whether its state and content come into
play at a specified point in time (its effectivity), whether the resource is what it
is said to be (its authenticity), and sometimes who has certified its authenticity
over time (its provenance). A resource might have persistence, but only the
provenance provided by an documented chain of custody enables questions
about authenticity to be answered with authority. Effectivity describes the limits
of a resource's lifespan on the time line.

Figure 4.6. Resources over Time.

Four considerations that arise with respect to the maintenance of resources
over time are their persistence, provenance, authenticity, and effectivity.

4.5.1 Persistence
Even if you have reached an agree­
ment as to the meaning of “a thing” in
your organizing system, you still face
the question of the identity of the re­
source over time, or its persistence.

The Great Sphinx at Giza

4.5.1.1 Persistent Identifiers
How long must an identifier last?
Coyle gives the conventional, if unsat­
isfying, answer: “As long as it is nee­
ded.” In some cases, the time frame is
relatively short. When you order a
specialty coffee and the barista asks
for your name, this identifier only
needs to last until you pick up your
order at the end of the counter. But
other time frames are much longer.
For libraries and repositories of scien­
tific, economic, census, or other data
the time frame might be “forever.”

The Great Sphinx has persisted for
over four thousand years. It has sur­
vived acts of vandalism, target prac­
tice by Napoleon’s artillery, shoulderdeep burial in desert sandstorms, and
eventual excavation in the early 20th
century.

The design of a scheme for persistent
identifiers must consider both the required time frame and the number of re­
sources to be identified. When the Internet Protocol (IP) was designed in 1980,
it contained a 32-bit address scheme, sufficient for over 4 billion unique ad­
dresses. But the enormous growth of the Internet and the application of IP ad­
dresses to resources of unexpected types have required a new addressing
scheme with 128 bits.220[Com]
Recognition that URIs are often not persistent as identifiers for web-based re­
sources led the Association of American Publishers (AAP) to develop the Digital
Object Identifier (DOI) system. The location and owner of a digital resource can
change, but its DOI is permanent.221[Com]

4.5.1.2 Persistent Resources
Even though persistence often has a technology dimension, it is more important
to view it as a commitment by an institution or organization to perform activi­
ties over time to ensure that a resource is available when it is needed. Put an­
other way, preservation (§3.5.2) and governance (§3.5.4) are activities carried
out to ensure the outcome of persistence.

4.5 Resources over Time

199

The Discipline of Organizing

The subtle relationship between preservation and persistence raises some inter­
esting questions about what it means for a resource to stay the same over time.
One way to think of persistence is that a persistent resource is never changed.
However, physical resources often require maintenance, repair, or restoration to
keep them accessible and usable, and we might question whether at some point
these activities have transformed them into different resources.222[Phil] Likewise,
digital resources require regular backup and migration to keep them available
and this might include changing their digital format.
Many resources like online newspapers or blog feeds continually change their
content but still have persistent identifiers. This suggests we should think of
persistence more abstractly, and consider as persistent resources any that re­
main functionally the same to support the same interactions at any point in their
lifetimes, even if their physical properties or information values change.
Active resources implemented as computational agents or web services might
be re-implemented numerous times, but as long as they do not change their in­
terfaces they can be deemed to be persistent from the perspective of other re­
sources that use them. Similarly, the dataset that defines a user or customer
model in a recommendation system should be treated as a persistent resource;
it includes information like name and date of birth that is persistent in the tradi­
tional sense; but it might also include “last purchase” and “current location,”
which must change frequently to maintain the accuracy and usefulness of the
customer model.

4.5.2 Effectivity
Many resources, or their properties, also have locative or temporal effectivity,
meaning that they come into effect at a particular time and/or place; will almost
certainly cease to be effective at some future date, and may cease to be effec­
tive in different places.
Temporal effectivity, sometimes known as “time-to-live,” is generally expressed
as a range of two dates. It consists of a date on which the resource is effective,
and optionally a date on which the resource ceases to be effective, or becomes
stale. For some types of resources, the effective date is the moment they are
created, but for others, the effective date can be a time different from the mo­
ment of creation. For example, a law passed in November may take effect on
January 1 of the following year, and credit cards first need to be activated and
then can no longer be used after their expiration date. An “effective date” is the
counterpart of the “Best Before” date on perishable goods. That date indicates
when a product goes bad, whereas an item’s effective date is when it “goes
good” and the resource that it supersedes needs to be disposed of or archived.

200

Chapter 4 — Resources in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

Locative effectivity considers borders,
security, roadways, altitude, depth
and other geographic factors. Some
types of resources, including people,
are restricted as to where they may
or may not be transported and/or
used, such as hazardous cargo, explo­
sives, narcotics, pharmaceuticals, al­
cohol, and cannabinoids. Jurisdiction­
al issues concern borders, transporta­
tion corridors, weather stations, and
geographic surveys. Parachutes are
altitude-sensitive and scuba diving
cylinders are depth-sensitive.

In Which Country Do You
Live?
Even if you always live in the same
place, the answer to “what country
do you live in?” can depend on
when it is asked. Consider the case
of an elderly woman born in 1929 in
Zemum, a district in the eastern Eu­
ropean city of Belgrade, who has
never moved. The place she lives
has been part of seven different
countries during her lifetime: King­
dom of Yugoslavia (1929-1941); In­
dependent
State
of
Croatia
(1941-1945); Federal People’s Re­
public of Yugoslavia (1945-1963);
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo­
slavia (1963-1992); Federal Repub­
lic of Yugoslavia (1992-2003); State
Union of Serbia and Montenegro
(2003-2006); Republic of Serbia
(2007—present).

Effectivity concerns sometimes inter­
sect with authority control for names
and places. Name changes for resour­
ces often are tied to particular dates,
events, and locations. Laws and regu­
lations differ across organizational
and geopolitical boundaries, and
those boundaries often change. Some
places that have been the site of civil
unrest, foreign occupation, and other
political disruptions have had many different names over time, and even at the
same time.224[Law]
Today these disputed borders cause a problem for Google Maps when it displays
certain international borders. Because Google is subject to the laws of the coun­
try where its servers are located, it must present disputed borders to conform
with the point of view of the host country when a country-specific Google site is
used to access the map.225[Com]
In most cases effectivity implies persistence requirements because it is impor­
tant to be able to determine and reconstruct the configuration of resources that
was in effect at some prior time. A new tax might go into effect on January 1,
but if the government audits your tax returns what matters is whether you fol­
lowed the law that was in effect when you filed your returns.226[Bus]

4.5.3 Authenticity
Do You Trust This?

Ustar.net sells photos autographed by celebri­
ties, and each comes with a Certificate of Au­
thenticity that includes a replica of the photo
and a signature from a Ustar employee to
guarantee that the autograph is an actual
hand-signed one. But Ustar does not provide a
certificate to guarantee that the employee sig­
nature is an authorized one.

In ordinary use we say that
something is authentic if it
can be shown to be, or has
come to be accepted as what
it claims to be. The impor­
tance and nuance of ques­
tions about authenticity can
be seen in the many words we
have to describe the relation­
ship between “the real thing”
(the “original”) and some­
thing else: copy, reproduc­
tion, replica, fake, phony, for­
gery, counterfeit, pretender,
imposter, ringer, and so on.
It is easy to think of examples
where authenticity of a re­
source matters: a signed legal
contract, a work of art, a his­
torical artifact, even a per­
son’s signature.

The creator or operator of an

human or machine, can au­

source. A third party can also
serve as proof of authenticity.
Many professional careers are based on figuring out if a resource is authen­
tic.227[Law]
There is a large body of techniques for establishing the identity of a person or
physical resource. We often use judgments about the physical integrity of recor­
ded information when we consider the integrity of its contents.
Digital authenticity is more difficult to establish. Digital resources can be repro­
duced at almost no cost, exist in multiple locations, carry different names on
identical documents or identical names on different documents, and bring about
other complications that do not arise with physical items. Technological solu­
tions for ensuring digital authenticity include time stamps, watermarking, en­
cryption, and digital signatures. However, while scholars generally trust techno­
logical methods, technologists are more skeptical of them because they can
202

Chapter 4 — Resources in Organizing Systems

Informatics Edition

imagine ways for them to be circumvented or counterfeited. Even when a tech­
nologically sophisticated system for establishing authenticity is in place, we can
still only assume the constancy of identity as far back as this system reaches in
the “chain of custody” of the document.

4.5.4 Provenance
In §3.2.2 we recommended that you analyze any evidence or records about the
use of resources as they made their way to you from their headwaters to ensure
they have maintained their quality over time. The concept of provenance trans­
forms the passive question of “what has happened to this resource?” into ac­
tions that can be taken to ensure that nothing bad can happen to a resource or
to enable it to be detected.
The idea that important documents must be created in a manner that can be au­
thenticated and then preserved, with an unbroken chain of custody, goes back
to ancient Rome. Notaries witnessed the creation of important documents,
which were then protected to maintain their integrity or value as evidence. In
organizing systems like museums and archives that preserve rare or culturally
important objects or documents this concern is expressed as the principle of
provenance. This is the history of the ownership of a collection or the resources
in it, where they have been and who has had access to the resources.
A uniquely Chinese technique in organizing systems is the imprinting of elabo­
rate red seals on documents, books, and paintings that collectively record the
provenance of ownership and the review and approval of the artifact by emper­
ors or important officials.
However, it is not only art historians and custodians of critical documents that
need to be concerned with provenance. If you are planning to buy a used car, it
is wise to check the vehicle history (using the Vehicle Identification Number, the
car’s persistent identifier) to make sure it hasn’t been wrecked, flooded, or sto­
len.

• We can consider a re­
source to be one of many
members of a very broad
category, as the unique in­
stance of a category with
only one member, or any­
where in between.
(See §4.1.1 What Is a Re­
source? (page 162))
• The size of the category—
the number of resources
that are treated as equiva­
lent—is determined by the
properties or characteris­
tics we consider when we
examine the resource.
(See §4.1.1 What Is a Re­
source? (page 162))
• Organizing systems for
physical information re­
sources emphasize de­
scription resources or sur­
rogates like bibliographic
records that describe the
information content rather
than their physical proper­
ties.

This beautiful manuscript, preserved in the
National Palace Museum in Taipei, was cre­
ated by Zhao Ji (
), Emperor Huizong, the
8th Emperor of the Chinese Song Dynasty
about a thousand years ago. He was famous
for his skills in poetry, painting, and calligra­
phy. There are two poems here; the one on the
right describes the techniques for Chinese
landscape paintings, while the left one ex­
presses the Emperor’s appreciation of plum
blossoms, which signal the onset of spring.
The red seals are those of several Ching Dy­
nasty emperors over many generations, with
the oldest being at least five hundred years af­
ter Huizong created the poems. Stamping your
personalized red seal on a resource is analo­
gous to but vastly more elegant and informa­
tive than “Liking” a web page today.

• Active resources create effects or value on their own, sometimes when they
initiate interactions with passive resources. Active resources can be people,
other living resources, computational agents, active information sources,
web-based services, self-driving cars, robots, appliances, machines or other­
wise ordinary objects like light bulbs, umbrellas, and shoes that have been
made “smarter.”
(See §4.2.3.2 Active or Operant Resources (page 173))
• More fine-grained organization reduces recall, the number of resources you
find or retrieve in response to a query, but increases the precision of the re­
called set, the proportion of recalled items that are relevant.
(See §4.3.3 Identity and Information Components (page 185))
• Agency is the extent to which a resource can initiate actions on its own. We
can define a continuum between completely passive resources that cannot
initiate any actions and active resources that can initiate actions based on
information they sense from their environments or obtain through interac­
tions with other resources.
(See §4.2.3 Resource Agency (page 172))
• Resources become active resources when they contain sensing and commu­
nication capabilities.
(See §4.2.3 Resource Agency (page 172))
• Which resources are primary and which are metadata is often just a decision
about which resource is the focus of our attention.
(See §4.2.4 Resource Focus (page 178))
• It can be useful to view domains of information resources on the Document
Type Spectrum from weakly-structured narrative content to highly struc­
tured transactional content.
(See the sidebar, The Document Type Spectrum (page 168))
• The concept of identity for bibliographic resources has evolved into a fourlevel abstraction hierarchy between the abstract work, an expression in mul­
tiple formats or genres, a particular manifestation in one of those formats or
genres, and a specific physical item.
(See §4.3.2 Identity and Bibliographic Resources (page 183) and Figure 4.5,
The FRBR Abstraction Hierarchy.)
• If the resource has an IP address, it is part of the “Internet of Things.”
(See §4.3.4 Identity and Active Resources (page 187).)

and in particular there are usually many words that can be used to refer to
the same thing or concept.

establish a controlled vocabulary. A controlled vocabulary is like a fixed or
closed dictionary that includes the terms that can be used in a particular do­
main. A controlled vocabulary shrinks the number of words used, reducing
synonymy and homonymy, eliminating undesirable associations, leaving be­
hind a set of words with precisely defined meanings and rules governing
their use.
(See §4.4.3.2 Use Controlled Vocabularies (page 195))
• For bibliographic resources important aspects of vocabulary control include
determining the authoritative forms for author names, uniform titles of
works, and the set of terms by which a particular subject will be known. In
library science, the process of creating and maintaining these standard
names and terms is known as authority control.
(See §4.4.3.2 Use Controlled Vocabularies (page 195))
• Preservation and governance are activities carried out to ensure that resour­
ces will last as long as they are needed.
(See §4.5.1 Persistence (page 199))
• Many resources, or their properties, also have locative or temporal effectivi­
ty, meaning that they come into effect at a particular time and/or place; will
almost certainly cease to be effective at some future date, and may cease to
be effective in different places.
(See §4.5.2 Effectivity (page 200))
• The only guarantee of a resource’s authenticity is having total oversight over
the “chain of custody” from its creation to the present.
(See §4.5.3 Authenticity (page 202) and §4.5.4 Provenance (page 203))

Separating information content from its structure and presentation is es­
sential to re-purposing it for different scenarios, applications, devices, or users.
The global information economy is increasingly driven by automated informa­
tion exchange between business processes. When information flows efficiently
from one type of document to another in this chain of related documents, the
overlapping content components act as the “glue” that connects the information
systems or web services that produce and consume the documents. (Glushko
and McGrath 2005).

taxonomy (which is unfair to Aristotle) but he certainly deserves enormous cred­

Systema Naturae, published in 1735. This seminal work contains the familiar
kingdom, class, order, family, genus, species hierarchy.

The ASCII scheme was standardized in the 1960s when computer mem­
ory was expensive and most computing was in English-speaking countries, so it
is minimal and distinguishes only 128 characters. (Cerf1969) American Stand­
ard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an ANSI specification. (See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII.)
[168][Com]

Unicode 6.0 (http://www.unicode.org/) has room to encode 109,449 char­
acters for all the writing systems in the world, so a single standard can repre­
sent the characters of every existing language, even “dead” ones like Sumerian
and Hittite. Unicode encodes the scripts used in languages, rather than lan­
guages per se, so there only needs to one representation of the Latin, Cyrillic,
Arabic, etc scripts that are used for writing multiple language. Unicode also dis­
tinguishes characters from glyphs, the different forms for the same character—
enabling different fonts to be identified as the same character.
[169][Com]

Encoding of structure in documents is valuable because titles, sections,
links and other structural elements can be leveraged to enhance the user inter­
face and navigational interactions with the digital document and enable more
precise information retrieval. Some uses of documents require formats that pre­
serve their printed appearance. “Presentational fidelity” is essential if we imag­
ine a banker or customs inspector carefully comparing a printed document with
a computer-generated one to ensure they are identical.

As a result, digital books are somewhat controversial and problematic
for libraries, whose access models were created based on the economics of print
publication and the social contract of the copyright first sale doctrine that al­
lowed libraries to lend printed books. Digital books change the economics and
first sale is not as well-established for digital works, which are licensed rather
than sold (Aufderheide and Jaszi 2011). To protect their business models, many
publishers are limiting the number of times ebooks can be lent before they “selfdestruct.” Some librarians have called for boycotts of publishers in response
(http://boycottharpercollins.com).

The opposing categories of operands and operants have their roots in de­

Luis Von Ahn (von Ahn 2004) was the first to use the web to get people
to perform “microwork” or “human computation” tasks when he released what
he called “the ESP game” that randomly paired people trying to agree on label­
ing an image. Not long afterward Amazon created the MTurk platform (http://
www.mturk.com) that lets people propose microwork and others sign up to do it,
and today there are both hundreds of thousands of tasks offered and hundreds
of thousands of people offering to be paid to do them.

For semi-structured or more narrative documents these descriptions
might be authoring templates used in word processors or other office applica­
tions, document schemas in XML applications, style sheets, or other kinds of
transformations that change one resource representation into another one. Pri­
mary resources that are highly and regularly structured are invariably organ­
ized in databases or enterprise information management systems in which a da­
ta schema specifies the arrangement and type of data contained in each field or
component of the resource.

er governments, whose unauthorized surveillance of global communications
were revealed in 2013 by Edward Snowden, often stressed that they were only
collecting message metadata, not its content. Of course, information about who
you communicate with and when you do so defines your social network, infor­
mation that is potentially very valuable, and the NSA knows this just as Face­
book and Twitter do.

The basic idea behind fantasy sports is quite simple. You select a team of
existing players in any sport, and then compare their statistical performance
against other teams similarly selected by other people. Fantasy sports appeal
mostly to die-hard fans who study player statistics carefully before “drafting”
their players. The global fantasy sports business for companies who organize
and operate fantasy leagues is estimated as between 1 and 2 billion US dollars
annually (Montague 2010).

These methods go by different names in different disciplines, including
“data modeling,” “systems analysis,” and “document engineering” (e.g., (Kent
2012), (Silverston 2000), (Glushko and McGrath 2005). What they have in com­
mon is that they produce conceptual models of a domain that specify their com­
ponents or parts and the relationships among these components or parts. These
conceptual models are called “schemas” or “domain ontologies” in some model­
ing approaches, and are typically implemented in models that are optimized for
particular technologies or applications.

Specifically, an NFL football team needs to be considered a single re­
source for games through the season and in playoffs, and 53 individual players
for other situations, like the NFL draft or play-calling. The team and the team’s
roster can be thought of as resources, and the team’s individual players are also
resources that make up the whole team.
[187][CogSci]

This kind of advice can be found in many data or conceptual modeling
texts, but this particular statement comes from (Glushko, Weaver, Coonan, and
Lincoln 1988). Similar advice can also be found in the information science liter­
ature: “A unit of information...would have to be...correctly interpretable outside
any context” (Wilson 1968, p. 18).

A group of techniques collectively called “normalization” produces a set
of tightly defined information components that have minimal redundancy and
ambiguity. Imagine that a business keeps information about customer orders us­
ing a “spreadsheet” style of organization in which a row contains cells that re­
cord the date, order number, customer name, customer address, item ID, item
description, quantity, unit price, and total price. If an order contains multiple
products, these would be recorded on additional rows, as would subsequent or­
[193][Com]

The Discipline of Organizing

ders from the same customer. All of this information is important to the busi­
ness, but this way of organizing it has a great deal of redundancy and inefficien­
cy. For example, the customer address recurs in every order, and the customer
address field merges street, city, state and zip code into a large unstructured
field rather than separating them as atomic components of different types of in­
formation with potentially varying uses. Similar redundancy exists for the prod­
ucts and prices. Canceling an order might result in the business deleting all the
information it has about a particular customer or product.
Normalization divides this large body of information into four separate tables,
one for customers, one for customer orders, one for the items contained in each
order, and one for item information. This normalized information model encodes
all of the information in the “spreadsheet style” model, but eliminates the re­
dundancy and avoids the data integrity problems that are inherent in it.
Normalization is taught in every database design course. The concept and meth­
ods were proposed by (Codd 1970), who invented the relational data model, and
has been taught to students in numerous database design textbooks like (Date
2003).
The “Internet of Things” concept spread very quickly after it was pro­
posed in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, who co-founded the Auto-ID center at MIT that
year to standardize RFID and sensor information. For a popular introduction,
see (Gershenfeld, Krikorian, and Cohen 2004). For a recent technical survey and
a taxonomy of application domains and scenarios see (Atzori, Iera, and Morabito
2010).

Pattern analysis can help escape this dilemma by enabling predictive
modeling to make optimal use of the data. In designing smart things and devi­
ces for people, it is helpful to create a smart model in order to predict the kinds
of patterns and locations relevant to the data collected or monitored. These al­
low designers to develop a set of dimensions and principles that will act as
smart guides for the development of smart things. Modeling helps to enable au­
tomation, security, or energy efficiency, and baseline models can be used to de­
tect anomalies. As for location, exact locations are unnecessary; use of a “sym­
bolic space” to represent each “sensing zone”—e.g., rooms in a house—and an
individual’s movement history as a string of symbols—e.g., abcdegia—works suf­
ficiently as a model of prediction. See (Das et al. 2002).

Different countries have rules about characters or words that may be used in
names. In Germany, for example, the government regulates the names parents
can give to their children; there’s even a book, the International Handbook of
Forenames, to guide them (Kulish 2009). In Portugal, the Ministry of Justice
publishes lists of prohibited names (BBC News, 2007a). Meanwhile, in 2007,
Swedish tax officials rejected a family’s attempt to name their daughter Metalli­
ca (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6525475.stm).
We can also change our names. Whether a woman takes on her husband’s sur­
name after marriage or, like the California man who changed his name to “Trout
Fishing,” we just find something that better suits us than our given name.
While you may think that certain terms are more obviously “good” than
others, studies show that “there is no one good access term for most objects.

The most common names for this service were activities, calendar and
events, but in all over a hundred different names were suggested, including cit­

surprisingly great variety of words to refer to the same thing,” Furnas wrote, “If
everyone always agreed on what to call things, the user’s word would be the de­
signer’s word would be the system’s word. ... Unfortunately, people often disa­
gree on the words they use for things” (Furnas et al. 1987, p. 964).

This example comes from (Farish 2002), who analyzes “What’s in a

idea because non-technical business users, data analysts, and system imple­

will work for all three audiences.

West published in print form. West won the case and Mead Data had to pay sub­

5.1 Introduction
This chapter is a turning point in the book. The earlier chapters have discussed
the key ideas of the discipline of organizing: identifying and selecting the re­
sources to organize, and then organizing and maintaining them and their organ­
izing system. We have emphasized that finding things later is the most impor­
tant reason for organizing them. This can be surprisingly hard to do. People
know things by different names or remember different aspects of them.

“Arrangement in Grey and
Black No. 1”

The famous painting here by the 19th
century American painter James
Whistler is exhibited in the Musée
d'Orsay in Paris, and has been descri­
bed as a Victorian-era Mona Lisa.
What name do you know it by? How
should it be described?
Resource descriptions for art usually
contain the name of the artist, the
medium, the year of its completion,
and, of course, its title. Most of these
map fairly obviously to the properties
they describe; the title, owing to its
prominence and expressive power, is
often an exception.

Most often, a painting's title de­
scribes its subject. If you recognize

Black, No. 1, because he believed the
most important property of a painting
was not the subject it depicted, but its purely aesthetic properties and their ef­
fect on the viewer. So Whistler named his paintings, which were mostly land­
scapes and portraits, in the manner of musical compositions: Nocturne in Black
and Gold; Symphony in White; Arrangement in Pink, Red, and Purple; and so on.
If Whistler’s title surprises you, because you would have described it as a por­
trait of an elderly woman, this helps reinforce how wildly different names of the
same resource can be. Resource descriptions and metadata provide meaning,
but to whom? What is salient about a resource can depend on the context in
which it is experienced, and thus may change over time. Descriptions that make
sense to some people might not make sense to others. People searching on the
“wrong descriptions” or the “wrong metadata” will not find what they are look­
ing for.

Mt. St. Helens, in the south­
west corner of Washington
State, was usually just descri­
bed as a mountain until 1980.
Then, the deadliest and most
economically destructive vol­
canic event in the history of
the United States blew away
the top of the mountain, kill­
ing 57 people, and leaving a
mile-wide crater. Today al­
most every description of Mt.
St. Helens mentions the vol­
canic eruption.

Mt. St. Helens Before and After

Before 1980, Mt. St. Helens was a “postcardlike” snow-covered mountain. Afterward, the
mile-wide crater where its mountaintop once
was reminds us of its violent volcanic eruption.

It would seem impossible to
search using the wrong description if the descriptions of a resource were kept
current to include all the latest information, but search engines are already too
powerful, usually producing too much information. Technology improvements in
search and retrieval do not eliminate the cognitive effort to remember what
things are, how they are best described, and where they might be found. The
design of resource descriptions and metadata depends on why we need to find
the information later. This chapter is about how and why.
It is easy to find before and after im­
ages of Mt. St. Helens doing a web
search. What information might be as­

also record information about the

where the photograph is taken. When the image is transferred out of the cam­
era and is published for all to see, it might be useful to record biographical in­
formation about the photographer to help viewers relate to the photographer
and better understand the photograph’s context. There may also be different li­
censes and copyright information to associate with the picture—who owns it
and how it can be used.

5.1 Introduction

The Discipline of Organizing

Consider a completely different context. Four 7-year old boys are selecting Lego
blocks to complete their latest construction. The first boy is looking for “cylin­
der one-ers,” another for “coke bottles,” the third for “golder wipers,” and the
final boy is looking for “round one-bricks”? It turns out, they are all the same
thing; each boy has devised his own set of descriptive terms for the tiny build­
ing blocks. Some of their many descriptions are based on color alone (“redder”),
some on color and shape (“blue tunnel”), some on role (“connector”), some on
common cultural touchstones (“light saber”). Others, like “jail snail” and “slug,”
seem unidentifiable—unless, of course, you happen to be inside the mind of a
particular 7-year-old kid. It doesn't matter if the boys use different description
vocabularies when they play by themselves, but they will have to agree if they
play together.229[CogSci]
Paintings, digital photos, and Lego blocks are all very different, but together
these scenarios raise important questions about describing resources that we
attempt to answer in this chapter:
• What is the purpose of resource description?
• What resource properties should be described?
• How are resource descriptions created?
• What makes a good resource description?

Navigating This Chapter
We begin with an overview of resource description (§5.2), which we
propose as a broad concept that includes the narrower concepts of
bibliographic descriptions and metadata. §5.3 The Process of Describ­
ing Resources (page 227) describes a 7-step process of describing re­
sources that includes determining scope, focus and purposes, identi­
fying resource properties, designing the description vocabulary, de­
signing the description form and implementation, and creating and
evaluating the descriptions. Because many principles and methods
for resource description were developed for describing text resour­
ces in physical formats, in §5.4 Describing Non-text Resources (page
257) we briefly discuss the issues that arise when describing muse­
um and artistic resources, images, music, video, and contextual re­
sources.

5.2 An Overview of Resource Description
We describe resources so that we can refer to them, distinguish among them,
search for them, manage access to them, preserve them, and make predictions
about what might happen to them or what they might do. Each purpose may re­
quire different resource descriptions. We use resource descriptions in every
communication and conversation; they are the enablers of organizing systems.

5.2.1 Naming {and, or, vs.} Describing
Chapter 4 discussed how to decide what things should be treated as resources
and how names and identifiers distinguish one resource from another. Names
can suggest the properties and principles an organizing system uses to arrange
its resources. We can see how societies organize their people by noting that
among the most common surnames in English are descriptions of occupations
(Smith, Miller, Taylor), descriptions of kinship relations (Johnson, Wilson, An­
derson), and descriptions of appearance (Brown, White).230[Ling]
In many cultures, one spouse or the other takes a name that describes their
marital relationship. In many parts of the English-speaking world, married wom­
en have often referred to themselves using their husband’s name.231[Ling]
Similarly, many other kinds of resources have names that are property descrip­
tions, including buildings (Pentagon, White House), geographical locations
(North America, Red Sea), and cities (Grand Forks, Baton Rouge).
Every resource can be given a name or identifier. Identifiers are especially effi­
cient resource descriptions because, by definition, identifiers are unique over
some domain or collection of resources. Names and identifiers do not typically
describe the resource in any ordinary sense because they are usually assigned
to the resource rather than recording a property of it.
However, the arbitrariness of names and identifiers means that they do not
serve to distinguish resources for people who do not already know them. This is
why we use what linguists call referring expressions or definite descriptions,
like “the small black dog” rather than the more efficient “Blackie,” when we are
talking to someone who does not know that is the dog’s name.232[CogSci]
Similarly, when we use a library catalog or search engine to locate a known re­
source, we query for it using its name, or some specific information we know
about it, to make it easier to find. In contrast, when we look for resources to sat­
isfy an information need but do not have specific resources in mind, we query
for them using descriptions of their content or other properties. In general, in­
formation retrieval can be characterized as comparing the description of a us­
er’s needs with descriptions of the resources that might satisfy them.

5.2.2 “Description” as an Inclusive Term
Up to now we have used the concept of “description” in its ordinary sense to
mean the labeling or explaining of the visible or important features that charac­
terize or represent something. However, the concept is sometimes used more
precisely in the context of organizing systems, where resource description is of­
ten more formal, systematic, and institutional. In the library science context of
bibliographic description, a descriptor is one of the terms in a carefully de­
signed language that can be assigned to a resource to designate its properties,
characteristics, or meaning, or its relationships with other resources. In the
contexts of conceptual modeling and information systems design, the terms in
resource descriptions are also called “keywords,” “index terms,” attributes, at­
tribute values, elements, “data elements,” “data values,” or “the vocabulary.” In
business intelligence, predictive analytics or other data science contexts these
are called “variables,” “features,” properties, or “measurements.” In contexts
where descriptions are less formal or more personal the description terms are
often called “labels” or “tags.” Rather than attempt to make fine distinctions
among these synonyms or near-synonyms, we will use “description” as an inclu­
sive term except where conventional usage overwhelmingly favors one of the
other terms.
Many of these terms come from a narrow semantic scope in which the purpose
of description is to identify and characterize the essence, or aboutness, of a re­
source. However, as it becomes trivial to associate computationally generated
information with resources, many additional kinds of information beyond strict
“aboutness” can support additional interactions. We describe many of these pur­
poses and the types of information needed to enable them in §5.3.2 Determining
the Purposes (page 234). We apply resource description in an expansive way to
accommodate all of them.
Chapter 4 introduced the distinction of §4.2.4 Resource Focus (page 178) to con­
trast primary resources with resources that describe them, which we called De­
scription Resources. We chose this term as a more inclusive and more easily un­
derstood alternative to two terms that are well established in organizing sys­
tems for information resources: bibliographic descriptions and metadata. We
will also distinguish resource description as a general concept from the narrow­
er senses of statistical description, tagging of web resources, and the Resource
Description Framework (RDF) language used to make statements about web re­
sources and physical resources that can be identified on the Web.

5.2.2.1 Bibliographic Descriptions
The purposes and nature of bibliographic description are the foundation of li­
brary and information science and have been debated and systematized for
nearly two centuries. Bibliographic descriptions characterize information re­
220

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

sources and the entities that populate the bibliographic universe, which include
works, editions, authors, and subjects.
A bibliographic description of an information resource is typically realized as a
structured record in a standardized format that describes a specific resource.
The computerization of bibliographic records made them easier to use as aids
for finding resources. However, digitizing legacy printed card-oriented descrip­
tions for online use was not a straightforward task because the descriptions had
been created according to cataloging rules designed for collections of books and
other physical resources and intended only for use by people.

5.2.2.2 Metadata
Metadata is often defined as “data about data,” a definition that is nearly as
ubiquitous as it is unhelpful. A more content-full definition of metadata is that it
is structured description for information resources of any kind. Metadata is
more useful when supported by a metadata schema that defines the elements in
the structured description.
The concept of metadata originated in information systems and database design
in the 1970s, so it is much newer than that of bibliographic description. The ear­
liest metadata schemas, called data dictionaries, documented the arrangement
and content of data fields in the records used by transactional applications on
mainframe computers. A more sophisticated type of metadata emerged as the
documentation of the data models in database management systems, called da­
tabase schemas, which described the structure of relational tables, attribute
names, and legal data types and values for content.
In 1986, the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) formalized the
Document Type Definition (DTD) as a metadata form for describing the struc­
ture and content elements in hierarchical and hypertextual document models.
SGML was superseded in 1997 by eXtensible Markup Language (XML), whose
purpose was structured and computer-processable web content.235[Com]
Today, XML schemas and other web- and compute-friendly formats for resource
description have broadened the idea of resource description far beyond that of
bibliographic description to include the description of software components,
business and scientific datasets, web services, and computational objects in
both physical and digital formats. The resource descriptions themselves serve to
enable discovery, reuse, access control, and the invocation of other resources
needed for people or computational agents to effectively interact with the pri­
mary ones described by the metadata.236[Com]

5.2.2.3 Tagging of Web-based Resources

Tags on Last.fm

Last.fm analyzes tags and other meta­
data to create rich multimedia “dis­
covery” pages that bring together ar­
tist catalogs, new songs, free down­
loads, and music videos that its algo­
rithm predicts will satisfy a user’s
taste. This allows users to browse for
new music in a more intuitive manner
than searching by artist or genre.

The concept of metadata has been ex­
tended to include the tags, ratings,
bookmarks or other types of descrip­
tions that individuals apply to individ­
ual photos, blog or news items, or any
other resource with a web presence.
The practice of tagging has emerged
as a way to apply labels to content in
order to describe and identify it. Sets
of tags are useful in managing one’s
collection of websites or digital me­
dia, in sharing them with others, and
enabling new types of interactions
and services.237[IA] For example, users
of Last.fm tag music with labels that
describe its nature, era, mood, or
genre, and Last.fm uses these tags to
generate radio stations that play mu­
sic similar to that tag and related
tags.

But tagging has a downside. The ten­
dency for users to tag intuitively and
spontaneously revives the vocabulary
problem (§4.4) because one photo­
grapher’s “tree” is another’s “oak.”
Likewise, unsystematic word choice
(Screenshot by Ian MacFarland.)
leads to morphological inconsistency
(§6.4.3 Relationships among Word
Forms (page 293)); the same photo might be tagged with “burning” and “trees”
and also with “burn” and “tree” by another. This disparity in the descriptors
people use to categorize the same or similar resources can turn systems that
use tagging into a “tag soup” lacking in structure.238[IA]
Some social media sites have incorporated mechanisms to make the tagging ac­
tivity more systematic and to reduce vocabulary problems. For example, on
Facebook, users can indicate that a specific person is in an uploaded picture by
clicking on the faces of people in photographs, typing the person’s name, and
then selecting the person from a list of Facebook friends whose names are for­
matted the way they appear on the friend’s profile. Some social media systems
suggest the most popular tags, perform morphological normalization, or allow
users to arrange tags in bundles or hierarchies.239[Web]

5.2.2.4 Resource Description Framework (RDF)
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for making
computer-processable statements about web resources; it is the foundation for
the vision of the Semantic Web.240[Web] We have been using the word “resource”
to refer to anything that is being organized. In the context of RDF and the web,
however, “resource” means something more specific: a resource is anything that
has been given a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). URIs can take various
forms, but you are probably most familiar with the URIs used to identify web pa­
ges, such as http://springfield-elementary.edu/. (You are probably also used to
calling these URLs instead of URIs.) The key idea behind RDF is that we can use
URIs to identify not only things “on” the web, like web pages, but also things
“off” the web like people or countries. For example, we might use the URI
http://springfield-elementary.edu/ to refer to Springfield Elementary itself, and
not just the school’s web page.
RDF models all descriptions as sets of “triples,” where each triple consists of
the resource being described (identified by a URI), a property, and a value.
Properties are resources too, meaning they are identified by URIs. For example,
the URI http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/schoolHomepage identifies a property defined
by the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) project for relating a person to (the web page
of) a school they attended. Values can be resources too, but they do not have to
be: when a property takes simple values like numbers, dates, or text strings,
these values do not have URIs and so are not resources.
Because RDF uses URIs to identify described resources, their properties, and
(some) property values, the triples in a description can be connected into a net­
work or graph. Figure 5.1, RDF Triples Arranged as a Graph. shows four triples
that have been connected into a graph. Two of the triples describe Bart Simp­
son, who is identified using the URI of his Wikipedia page.241[Web] The other two
describe Lisa Simpson. Two of the triples use the property age, which takes a
simple number value. The other two use the property schoolHomepage, which
takes a resource value, and in this case they happen to have the same resource
(Springfield Elementary’s home page) as their value.

5.2 An Overview of Resource Description

223

The Discipline of Organizing

Figure 5.1. RDF Triples Arranged as a Graph.

Two RDF triples can be connected to form a graph when they have a resource,
property, or value in common. In this example RDF triples that make a state­
ment about the home page of the elementary school attended by Bart Simpson
and Lisa Simpson can be connected because they have the same value, namely
the URI for Springfield Elementary.

Using URIs as identifiers for resources and properties allows descriptions mod­
eled as RDF to be interconnected into a network of “linked data,” in the same
way that the web enabled information to be interconnected into a massive net­
work of “linked documents.” Proponents of RDF claim that this will greatly ben­
efit knowledge discovery and inference.242[Web] But the benefits of RDF’s highly
prescriptive description form must be weighed against the costs; turning exist­
ing descriptions into RDF can be labor-intensive.

5.2.2.5 Aggregated Information Objects
In the pre-digital age, information objects came with explicit tangible bounda­
ries. Books consisted of pages bound within a cover, a vinyl record album physi­
cally bound together a set of songs (you could even see the groove pattern sepa­
rating the songs), a movie was delivered on a strip of film spooled onto a reel,
and a collection was (usually) demarcated as a designated shelf or room in a li­
brary.
Boundaries of information objects in the digital realm are neither tangible nor
obvious. Consider the simple notion of a web page. Our cognitive notion of that
which is rendered in our browser window (e.g., some formatted text with an as­
sociated image) is actually, in web architecture terms (Jacobs & Walsh, 2004),
three information objects (aka resources); the HTML encoding the text, CSS
that defines the formatting rules, and the JPEG that encodes the image. All
three have URLs and can independently be retrieved and linked. The situation is
even more ambiguous for the common notion of a web site, the boundaries of
which are not defined technically and are cognitively difficult to express.

224

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

Aggregations can be convenience methods for simplifying dissemination or or­
ganization, but they can also be transformative; resources can derive nearly all
their value from their inclusion in an aggregation. On a web page, the CSS file
is virtually useless on its own, since its role is to style the HTML file. In iTunes,
the playback and organization functions are optimized for pop music, where in­
dividual songs can usually stand on their own when separated from the rest of
an album. Classical music fans often struggle with this, because the individual
“tracks” of a recording, split up to reduce file size and facilitate navigation
through long works, are not separable; pieces are meant to be listened to in
their entirety, and it can be difficult to ensure that they are aggregated together
and have the proper metadata assigned to their aggregations. In other words:
you can't listen to symphonies on shuffle.244[IA]
The problem here is how to architecturally and technically express the notion of
an aggregation, a set of information objects that, when considered together,
compose another named information object. Aggregations are prevalent all over
our digital information space: the web page and site mentioned above; a schol­
arly publication consisting of text, figures, and data; a dataset that is the compo­
sition of multiple data files. Notably the notion is both recursive and nonexclusive. An object that is itself an aggregation may be aggregated into anoth­
er object. Information objects included in one aggregation may also be included
in other aggregations, allowing reuse and re-factoring of existing information
objects. A solution to this problem is a critical aspect of organizing digital infor­
mation because, without well-defined boundaries we cannot deterministically
identify, reference, or describe information objects.

5.2.3 Frameworks for Resource Description
The broad scope of resources to which descriptions can be applied and the dif­
ferent communities that describe them means that many frameworks and classi­
fications have been proposed to help make sense of resource description.

Figure 5.2. Architectures for Resource Description.

Two contrasting architectures for resource descriptions are separate descrip­
tions versus packaged descriptions, which were dominant in library catalogs
with printed cards containing descriptions about a resource.

The dominant historical view treats resource descriptions as a package of state­
ments; this view is embodied in the printed library card catalog and its compu­
terized analog in the MARC21 format (an exchange format for library catalog
records), which contains many fields about the bibliographic characteristics of
an object like author, title, publication year, publisher, and pagination. An alter­
nate architecture for resource description focuses on each individual descrip­
tion or assertion about a single resource, as the RDF and linked data ap­
proaches do. These two alternatives are contrasted in Figure 5.2, Architectures
for Resource Description.
226

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

In either case, these common ways of thinking about resource description em­
phasize—or perhaps even overemphasize—two implementation decisions:
• The first is whether to combine multiple resource descriptions into a struc­
tural package or to keep them as separate descriptive statements.
• The second is the choice of syntax in which the descriptions are encoded.
Both of these implementation decisions have important implications, but are
secondary to the questions about the purposes of resource description, how re­
source properties are selected as the basis for description, how they are best
created, and other logical or design considerations. In keeping with a funda­
mental idea of the discipline of organizing (introduced in §1.6 The Concept of
“Organizing Principle” (page 43)), it is imperative to distinguish design princi­
ples from implementation choices. We treat the set of implementation decisions
about character notations, syntax, and structure as the form of resource de­
scription and we will defer them as much as we can until Chapter 9, The Forms
of Resource Descriptions.
Resource description is not an end in itself. Its many purposes are all means for
enabling and using an organizing system for some collection of resources. As a
result, our framework for resource descriptions aligns with the activities of or­
ganizing systems we discussed in Chapter 3: selecting, organizing, interacting
with, and maintaining resources.

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources
We prefer the general concept of resource description over the more specialized
ones of bibliographic description and metadata because it makes it easier to see
the issues that cut across the domains where those terms dominate. In addition,
it enables us to propose more standard process that we can apply broadly to the
use of resource descriptions in organizing systems. A shared vocabulary enables
the sharing of lessons and best practices.
The process of describing resources involves seven interdependent and iterative
steps. We begin with a generic summary of the process to set the stage for a de­
tailed step-by-step discussion.
1. Identifying resources to describe is the first step; this topic is covered in de­
tail in §4.3 Resource Identity (page 182). The resource domain and scope cir­
cumscribe the describable properties and the possible purposes that de­
scriptions might serve. The resource focus determines which are primary in­
formation resources and which ones are treated as the corresponding re­
source descriptions. Two important decisions at this stage are granularity of
description—are we describing individual resources or collections of them?

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

227

The Discipline of Organizing

—and the abstraction level—are we describing resource instances, parts of
them, or resource types?
2. Generally, the purpose of resource description is to support the activities
common to all organizing systems: selecting, organizing, interacting with,
and maintaining resources, as we saw in Chapter 3. The particular resource
domain and the context in which descriptions are created and used imposes
more specific requirements and constraints on the purposes that resource
description can serve.
3. Once the purposes of description in terms of activities and interactions have
been determined, the specific properties of the resources that are needed to
enable them can be identified. The goal of description is not to be exhaus­
tive; there are always more possible properties than can be reasonably de­
scribed. Instead, the challenge is to use the properties that are most robust
and reliable for supporting the desired interactions.
4. This step includes several logical and semantic decisions about how the re­
source properties will be described. What terms or element names should be
used to identify the resource properties we have chosen to describe? Are
there rules or constraints on the types of data or values that the property de­
scriptions can assume? When dealing with numerical descriptions, their data
types and levels of measurement constrain the kinds of processing to which
they may submit. Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data each are limited
to particular transformations based on what they represent. A good descrip­
tion vocabulary will be easy to assign when creating resource descriptions
and easy to understand when using them.
5. The logical and semantic decisions about the description vocabulary are rei­
fied by decisions about the notation, syntax and structure of the descrip­
tions. Taken together, these decisions collectively determine what we call
the form or encoding of the resource descriptions. The implementation of
the descriptions involves decisions about how and where they are stored and
the technology used to create, edit, store, and retrieve them.
6. Resource descriptions are created by individuals, by informal or formal
groups of people, or by automated or computational means. Some types of
descriptions can only be created by people, some types of descriptions can
only be created by automated or algorithmic techniques, and some can be
created in either manner.
7. The resource descriptions must be evaluated with respect to their intended
purposes. The results of this evaluation will help determine which or the
preceding steps need to be redone.
The next seven sub-sections discuss each of these steps in detail. A quick refer­
ence guide is Figure 5.3, The Process of Describing Resources.

228

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Figure 5.3. The Process of Describing Resources.

The process of describing resources consists of seven steps: Determining the
scope and focus, determining the purpose, identifying resource properties, de­
signing the description vocabulary, designing the description form and imple­
mentation, creating the descriptions, and evaluating the descriptions.

How explicit and systematic each step needs to be depends on the resource do­
main and scope, and especially on the intended users of the organizing system.
If we look carefully, we can see most of these steps taking place even in very in­
formal contexts, like the kids playing with Lego blocks with which we started
this chapter. The goal of building things with the blocks leads the boys to identi­
fy which properties are most useful to analyze. They develop descriptions of the
blocks that capture the specific values of the relevant properties. Finally, they
evaluate their descriptions by using them when they play together; it becomes

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

229

The Discipline of Organizing

immediately obvious that a description is not serving its purpose when one boy
hands a block to another that was not the one he thought he had asked for.
In contrast, a picture-taking scenario involves a much more explicit and system­
atic process of resource description. The resource properties, description vo­
cabulary, and description form used automatically by a digital camera were
chosen by an industry association and published as a technical specification im­
plemented by camera and mobile phone manufacturers worldwide.
The resource descriptions used by libraries, archives, and museums are typical­
ly created in an even more explicit and systematic manner. Like the descriptions
of the digital photo, the properties, vocabulary, and form of the descriptions
used by their organizing systems are governed by standards. However, there is
no equivalent to the digital camera that can create these descriptions automati­
cally. Instead, highly trained professionals create them meticulously.
A great many resources and their associated descriptions in business and scien­
tific organizing systems are created by automated or computational processes,
so the process of describing individual resources is not at all like that in libra­
ries and other memory institutions. However, the process for designing the data
models or schemas for the class of resources that will be generated is equally
systematic and is typically performed by highly skilled data analysts and data
modelers.

5.3.1 Determining the Scope and Focus
Which resources do we want to describe? As we saw in Chapter 4, determining
what will be treated as a separate resource is not always easy, especially for re­
sources with component parts and for information resources where the most im­
portant property is their content, which is not directly perceivable. Identifying
the thing you want to describe as precisely as practical is the first step to creat­
ing a useful description.
In §4.2.4 Resource Focus (page 178), we introduced the contrast between pri­
mary resources and description resources, which we called resource focus. De­
termining the resource focus goes hand in hand with determining which resour­
ces we intend to describe; these often arbitrary decisions then make a huge dif­
ference in the nature and extent of resource description. One person’s metadata
is another person’s data.
• For a librarian, the price of a book might be just one more attribute that is
part of the book’s record.
• For an accountant at a bookstore, the price of that book—both the cost to
buy the book and the price at which it is then sold to customers—is critical
information for staying in business.

• In a medical records context, a patient’s insurance provider isn’t of much
concern to the doctor, but to the person responsible for billing, it is central.
For the nurse, the patient’s current vital signs may be of most importance,
while for the doctor, it may be most important to understand how those data
in aggregate serve to indicate a longer-term prognosis of the patient’s
health.
• A scientist studying comparative anatomy preserves animal specimens and
records detailed physical descriptions about them, but a scientist studying
ecology or migration discards the specimens and focuses on describing the
context in which the specimen was located.

5.3.1.1 Describing Instances or Describing Collections
It is simplest to think of a resource description as being associated with another
individual resource. As we discussed in Chapter 4, it is challenging to determine
what to treat as an individual resource when resources are themselves objects
or systems composed of other parts or resources. For example, we sometimes
describe a football team as a single resource and at other times we focus on
each individual player. However, after deciding on resource granularity, the
question remains whether each resource needs a separate description.
Libraries and museums specialize in curating resource descriptions about the
instances in their collections. Resource descriptions are also applied to classes
or collections of resources, because a collection is also a resource (§1.4 The
Concept of “Collection” (page 37)). Archives and special collections of maps are
typically assigned resource descriptions, but each document or map contained
in the collection does not necessarily have its own bibliographic description.
Similarly, business and scientific datasets are invariably described at collectionlevel granularity because they are often analyzed in their entirety.
Furthermore, the granularity of description for a collection of resources tends
to differ for different users or purposes. An investor who owns many different
stocks focuses on their individual prices, while other investors put their money
in index funds that combine all the separate prices into a single value.
Many web pages, especially e-commerce product catalogs and news sites, are
dynamically assembled and personalized from a large number of information re­
sources and services that are separately identified and described in content
management and content delivery systems. However, a highly complex collec­
tion of resources that comes together in a single page is treated as a single re­
source when that page appears in a list of search engine results. Moreover, all
of the separately generated pages can be given a single description when a user
creates a bookmark to make it easy to return to the home page of the site.

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

231

The Discipline of Organizing

5.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Description
We can also associate resource descriptions with an entire type or domain of re­
sources. (See §3.5.2.4 Preserving Resource Types (page 138) and §4.2.1 Resource
Domain (page 167).) A collection of resource descriptions is vastly more useful
when every resource is described using common description elements or terms
that apply to every resource. A schema (or model, or metadata standard) speci­
fies the set of descriptions that apply to an entire resource type. Sometimes this
schema, model, or standard is inferred from or imposed on a collection of exist­
ing resources to ensure more consistent definitions, but more often, it is used as
a specification when the resources are created or generated in the first place.
(See What about “Creating” Resources? (page 90) in §3.1 Introduction (page
87).)
A relational database, for example, is easily conceptualized as a collection of re­
cords organized as one or more tables, with each record in its own row having a
number of fields or attributes that contain some prescribed type of content.
Each record or row in the database table is a description of a resource—an em­
ployee, a product, anything—and the individual attribute values, organized by
the columns and rows of the table, are distinct parts of the description for some
particular resource instance, like employee 24 or product 8012C.251[Com]
The information resources that we commonly call documents are, by their na­
ture, less homogeneous in content and structure than those that can be man­
aged in databases. Document schemas, commonly represented in SGML or
XML, usually allow for a mixture of data-like and textual descriptive elements.
XML schema languages have improved on SGML and XML by expressing the
description of the document schema in XML itself, making it easy to create re­
sources using the metadata as a template or pattern. XML schemas are often
used as the specifications for XML resources created and used by informationintensive applications; in this context, they are often called XML vocabularies.
XML schemas can be used to define web forms that capture resource instances
(each filled-out form). XML schemas are also used to describe the interfaces to
web services and other computational resources.252[Com]

5.3.1.3 Scope, Scale, and Resource Description
If we only had one thing to describe, we could use a single word to describe it:
“it.” We would not need to distinguish it from anything else. A second resource
implies at least one more term in the description language: “not it.” However, as
a collection grows, descriptions must become more complex to distinguish not
only between, but also among resources.
Every element or term in a description language creates a dimension, or axis,
along which resources can be distinguished, or it defines a set of questions

232

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

about resources. Distinctions and questions that arise frequently need to be
easy to address, such as:
• What is the name of the resource?
• Who created it?
• What type of content or matter does it contain?
Therefore, as a collection grows, the language for describing resources must be­
come more rigorous, and descriptions created when the collection was small of­
ten require revision because they are no longer adequate for their intended pur­
poses.
Because the task of library resource description has been standardized at na­
tional and international levels, cataloging work is distributed among many de­
scribers whose results are shared. The principle of standardization has been the
basis of centralized bibliographic description for a century.
Centralized resource description by skilled professionals works for libraries, but
even in the earliest days of the web many library scientists and web authoring
futurists recognized that this approach would not scale for describing web re­
sources. In 1995, the Dublin Core (DC) metadata element set with only 15 ele­
ments was proposed as a vastly simpler description vocabulary that people not
trained as professional catalogers could use. Since then, the Dublin Core initia­
tive has been highly influential in inspiring numerous other communities to cre­
ate minimalist description vocabularies, often by simplifying vocabularies that
had been devised by professionals for use by non-professionals.
Of course, a simpler description vocabulary makes fewer distinctions than a
complex one; replacing “author,” “artist,” “composer” and many other descrip­
tions of the person or non-human resource responsible for the intellectual con­
tent of a resource with just “creator” (as Dublin Core does) results in a substan­
tial loss of precision when the description is created and can cause misunder­
standing when the descriptions are reused.256[CogSci]
The negative impacts of growing scope and scale on resource description can
sometimes be avoided if the ultimate scope and scale of the organizing system
is contemplated when it is being created. It would not be smart for a business
with customers in six US states to create an address field in its customer data­
base that only handled those six states; a more extensible design would allow
for any state or province and include a country code. In general, however, just
as there are problems in adapting a simple vocabulary as scope and scale in­
crease, designing and applying resource descriptions that will work for a large
and continuously growing collection might seem like too much work when the
collection at hand is small.

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

233

The Discipline of Organizing

The challenges that arise with large description vocabularies are transformed
when resource descriptions are created and assigned by computer algorithms. A
large dataset might contain many thousands of descriptions for each resource,
but clearly the computer does not have cognitive difficulty generating or using
them. However, computer models with this many features can be hard for peo­
ple to understand and trust.

5.3.2 Determining the Purposes
Resource description serves many purposes, and the mix of purposes and the
resulting kinds of descriptions in any particular organizing system depends on
the scope and scale of the resources being organized. We can identify and clas­
sify the most common purposes using the four activities that occur in every or­
ganizing system: selecting, organizing, interacting with, and maintaining re­
sources (see Chapter 3). Resource description also has a more open-ended pur­
pose in sensemaking and science (see §5.3.2.5); we observe and describe the
world to make sense of our experiences and to predict future observations.

5.3.2.1 Resource Description to Support Selection
Defining selection as the process by which resources are identified, evaluated,
and then added to a collection in an organizing system emphasizes resource de­
scriptions created by someone other than the person who is using them. We can
distinguish several different ways in which resource description supports selec­
tion:
Discovery
What available resources might be added to a collection? New resources are
often listed in directories, registries, or catalogs. Some types of resources
are selected and acquired automatically through subscriptions or contracts.
Capability and Compatibility
Will the resource meet functional or interoperability requirements?
Technology-intensive resources often have numerous specialized types of de­
scriptions that specify their functions, performance, reliability, and other “ilities” that determine if they fit in with other resources in an organizing sys­
tem. 257[Com] Some services have qualities of service levels, terms and condi­
tions, or interfaces documented in resource descriptions that affect their
compatibility and interoperability. Some resources have licensing or usage
restrictions that might prevent the resources from being used effectively for
the intended purposes. Decisions about “people selection” are becoming
more data-driven, and sports teams, business employers,and dating sites
now rely on predictive statistics to find the best person.

Authentication
Is the resource what it claims to be? (§4.5.3 Authenticity (page 202)) Re­
source descriptions that can support authentication include technological
ones like time stamps, watermarking, encryption, checksums, and digital
signatures. The history of ownership or custody of a resource, called its
provenance (§4.5.4 Provenance (page 203)), is often established through as­
sociation with sales or tax records. Import and export certificates associated
with the resource might be required to comply with laws designed to pre­
vent the theft of antiquities or the transfer of technology or information with
national security or foreign policy implications.
Appraisal
What is the value of this resource? What is its cost? At what rate does it de­
preciate? Does it have a shelf life? Does it have any associated ratings, rank­
ings, or quality measures? Moreover, what is the quality of those ratings,
rankings and measures?
We also consider the perspective of the person creating the resource descrip­
tion and his or her primary purpose, which is often to encourage the selection of
the resource by someone else. Product marketing is about devising names and
descriptions to make a resource distinctive and attractive compared to alterna­
tives. For many years prunes were promoted as a dietary supplement that peo­
ple (especially old ones) need to “maintain regularity.” But after the California
Prune Board (the world’s biggest supplier) re-branded them as “dried plums”
and started marketing them as a snack food (and simultaneously renaming itself
as the California Dried Plum Board) sales increased significantly.258[Bus]
Many countries require that imported goods are labeled with their country or
origin. Consumers often use this property in resource descriptions as an indica­
tor of high quality, as they might with Swiss watches, French or Italian fashions,
or Canadian bacon. Alternatively, consumers might want to buy domestic or
locally-sourced goods out of economic patriotism or to comply with procurement
regulations. Not surprisingly, when consumers view origin in a positive light,
this information is conspicuous and easy to read. In contrast, when consumers
view origin less positively, perhaps as a warning of low quality goods, the suppli­
er is likely to make the origin information as inconspicuous as legally possible,
or might even misrepresent the goods as domestic ones.259[Bus]
This misrepresentation is also ubiquitous in online dating, though the amount of
misrepresentation must be balanced with goals of the relationship and chances
of the deception being discovered.260[CogSci]

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

235

The Discipline of Organizing

5.3.2.2 Resource Description to Support Organizing
We have defined organizing as specifying the principles for describing and ar­
ranging resources to create the capabilities upon which interactions are based.
This definition treats the creation of resource descriptions and their use to or­
ganize resources for interactions as separate and sequential activities. This is
easiest to see when people assign keywords and classifications to documents, or
when sensors produce data, and these resource descriptions are later used to
enable document retrieval or data analysis. A department store clerk might sort
dress shirts on a display table using labels that describe their brands, sizes, and
other properties. Rules governing the collection, integration, and analysis of
personal information are also resource descriptions that influence the organiza­
tion of information resources.
However, even if resource description and resource organization are logically
separable, at times they are intertwined. When you arrange your own clothes,
you don’t use explicit resource descriptions and instead rely on implicit ones
about easily perceived properties like color, shape, and material of composition.
When algorithms rather than people analyze texts to identify descriptive fea­
tures for applications like information retrieval, spam classification, and senti­
ment analysis, resource descriptions and resource organization co-evolve, often
continuously as the algorithm adapts and learns with each new resource it de­
scribes. This tight connection between resource description and resource or­
ganization is also exploited in organizing systems that use usage records from
session logs, browsing, or downloading activities as interaction resources, tying
them to payments for using the resources or analyzing them to influence the se­
lection and organizing of resources in future personalized interactions. (See
§1.9 The Concept of “Interaction Resource” (page 51))

5.3.2.3 Resource Description to Support Interactions
Most discussions of the purposes of resource descriptions and metadata empha­
size the interactions that are based on resource descriptions that have been in­
tentionally and explicitly assigned. The Functional Requirements for Biblio­
graphic Records (FRBR), defined by library scientists, specifies the four interac­
tions of Finding, Identifying, Selecting, and Obtaining resources, but these ap­
ply generically to organizing systems, not just those in libraries.
Finding
What resources are available that “correspond to the user’s stated search
criteria” and thus can satisfy an information need? Modern users accept that
computerized indexing makes search possible over not only the entire de­
scription resource, but often over the entire content of the primary resource.
Businesses search directories for descriptions of company capabilities to

236

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

find potential partners, and they also search for descriptions of application
interfaces (APIs) that enable them to exchange information in an automated
manner.
Identifying
Another purpose of resource description is to enable a user to confirm the
identity of a specific resource or to distinguish among several that have
some overlapping descriptions. Computer processable resource descriptions
like bar codes, QR codes, or RFID tags are also used to identify resources. In
Semantic Web contexts, URIs serve this purpose. Color can be used as re­
source descriptions when physical resources need to be identified quick­
ly.262[CogSci]
Selecting
Selecting in this context means the user activity of using resource descrip­
tions to support a choice of resource from a collection, not the institutional
activity of selecting resources for the collection in the first place. Search en­
gines typically use a short “text snippet” with the query terms highlighted as
resource descriptions to support selection. People often select resources
with the least restrictions on uses as described in a Creative Commons li­
cense.263[Law] A business might select a supplier or distributor that uses the
same standard or industry reference model to describe its products or busi­
ness processes because it is almost certain to reduce the cost of doing busi­
ness with that business partner.264[Bus]
Obtaining
Physical resources often require significant effort to obtain after they have
been selected. Catching a bus or plane involves coordinating your current
location and time with the time and location the resource is available. With
information resources in physical form, obtaining a selected resource usual­
ly meant a walk through the library stacks. With digital information resour­
ces, a search engine returns a list of the identifiers of resources that can be
accessed with just another click, so it takes little effort to go from selecting
among the query results to obtaining the corresponding primary re­
source.265[Web]
Elaine Svenonius proposed that a fifth task called Navigation be added to the
FRBR list, and in 2016 that happened but it was renamed as “Explore”:
Navigation or Explore
If users are not able to specify their information needs in a way that the find­
ing functionality requires, they should be able to use relational and structur­
al descriptions among the resources to navigate from any resource to other
ones that might be better. Svenonius emphasizes generalization, aggrega­
tion, and derivational relationships. But in principle, any relationship or
property could serve as the navigation “highway” between resources.
5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

237

The Discipline of Organizing

What some authors call “structural metadata” can be used to support the re­
lated tasks of moving within multi-part digital resources like electronic
books, where each page might have associated information about previous,
next, and other related pages. Documents described using XML models can
use Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) and XPath to
address and select data elements, sub-trees, or other structural parts of the
document.268[Com]

5.3.2.4 Resource Description to Support Maintenance
Many types of resource descriptions that support selection (§5.3.2.1 Resource
Description to Support Selection (page 234)) are also useful over time to support
maintenance of specific resource and the collection to which they belong. In
particular, technical information about resource formats and technology (soft­
ware, computers, or other) needed to use the resources, and information nee­
ded to ensure resource integrity is often called “preservation metadata” in a
maintenance context.
Resource descriptions that are more exclusively associated with maintenance
activities include version information and effectivity, or useful life information.
Equipment maintenance schedules are typically related to the number of miles
driven (indicated by a car’s odometer), number of hours operated (stored by
many engines), number of pages printed, or other easily recorded information
about resource use or interactions. With smart resources now capable of captur­
ing, analyzing, and communicating more data about real-time performance,
more sophisticated prediction and scheduling of maintenance work is now pos­
sible. It is also easier to identify resources that are not being used as much as
expected, which might imply that they are no longer needed and can thus be
safely archived or discarded.

5.3.2.5 Resource Description for Sensemaking and Science
Up to now in §5.3.2, we have discussed how resource descriptions are used to
perform well-defined tasks within an existing organizing system. However, there
is a broader and less well-defined purpose of resource description that is older
and more fundamental: the use of resource descriptions as the raw material for
making sense of the world.
For thousands of years, even before the invention of written language, people
have systematically collected things, information about those things, and obser­
vations of all kinds to understand how their world works. Paleolithic humans
made cave paintings depicting the results of hunts and animal migrations; an­
cient Egyptians recorded the annual floods of the Nile River in stone carvings;
and Babylonian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican astronomers organized

238

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

lunar, solar, and planetary observations as calendars starting about five thou­
sand years ago.
These diverse efforts to impose meaning on experience by recording, analyzing,
organizing, and reorganizing observations can be collectively described as
sensemaking. (See the sidebar, Sensemaking and Organizing (page 240).)
Some aspects of sensemaking are hard-wired by evolution, which has given our
brains powerful mechanisms that automatically simplify and organize the per­
ceptual data we obtain from the world (see the sidebar Gestalt Principles (page
102)). But this automatic sensemaking is dominated and amplified by intentional
sensemaking.
Intentional sensemaking takes place when systematic statistical, experimental,
and scientific methods are consciously followed to extract and organize knowl­
edge from collections of samples, observations, or measurements. It is critical
to recognize here that the contents of these collections represent choices made
about what to collect, because most things and most phenomena have a great
many descriptions or properties that could be recorded about them.
After things or data have been collected, statistical methods summarize the val­
ues of properties in a collection or dataset and the relationships among them.
Making sense of a single collection or dataset by determining the properties
that contrast and classify the instances is the start toward the more important
goal of understanding the larger set or population from which the initial collec­
tion is just a sample. There is no better example of this than the periodic table
of elements developed by Mendeleev in 1869, who organized known elements
on the basis of their common chemical properties and then successfully predic­
ted some properties of yet undiscovered ones.
Computational models developed from the initial dataset can predict future ob­
servations. Classification models assign a new instance to a category (e.g., spam
or not spam message, Madison or Hamilton as author, outdoor or indoor scene);
regression models predict a specific value of some measurement (given a de­
scription of a new movie, how much money will it make?); ordinal regression
models predict values for non-metric measures (how much will you like the mov­
ie?). Experimental methods for hypothesis testing help develop and refine mod­
els of any type by systematically varying the conditions under which observa­
tions are made to discover how the results change in different situations.
A fundamental challenge in sensemaking and modeling is finding a balance be­
tween the competing goals of understanding a particular collection or dataset
and being able to apply that understanding to new instances. Models can differ
in the number of resource descriptions they use as parameters, and it is easy
and tempting to overfit a model by using more parameters that capture random

Sensemaking and Organizing
People organize to make sense of equivocal inputs and enact this sense back
into the world to make it more orderly.

— (Weick 2005)

Sensemaking and organizing are intertwined. Ancient cultures recorded
time-based observations and analyzed patterns among crop cycles, com­
modity prices, weather conditions, and astronomical sightings. Think back
to the early astronomers, who oriented temple buildings to align with astro­
nomical events and who decorated temple walls with zodiac imagery.
• Which of the planets and stars in the night sky should they observe and
how should they record the details of those observations?
• What mathematical and statistical techniques should be used to analyze
and describe these observations?
• What subset of observations are most useful in predicting the onset of
the Nile River floods, caused by unobserved rainfall thousands of miles
away?
Every choice about what to observe and how to describe it reflects a set of
assumptions and potential hypotheses that are often implicit and unstated.
Choices that increase understanding are built upon, and those that fail to
provide insight are abandoned, but there is no guarantee that the iterative
process of choosing what to observe and describe will lead to a correct un­
derstanding.
The principle that an accurate or comprehensive dataset is insufficient on
its own to yield a correct model is exemplified in the interlocking efforts of
Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Brahe was a 16th-century Danish noble­
man astronomer who spent decades collecting data about the positions of
hundreds of stars and the planets. However, because of prevailing religious
and scientific biases, Brahe accepted the incorrect assumptions that the sun
and planets revolved around the earth in circular orbits. After Brahe died in
1601, Kepler spent a decade analyzing Brahe's data, and then rejected the
idea of earth-centric and circular planetary orbits in favor of elliptical ones
with the sun at one focus. These new organizing principles for Brahe’s data
made the model of the solar system vastly simpler, and Kepler was able to
discover laws of planetary motion that are part of the foundation of modern
astronomy and physics.270[DS]
variations in observations. Overfitting produces spurious accuracy in reproduc­
ing the original observations, but it makes models less generalizable.
240

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

The highest level of sensemaking is the creation of scientific models or theories
that propose interpretable and causal mechanisms for the observations. And
just as automatic sensemaking creates simple explanations, scientists generally
prefer simpler theories, a heuristic known as Occam’s Razor, or the law of parsi­
mony. Even though complex theories can sometimes be more accurate, simpler
theories produce more testable predictions, making it easier to verify or refine
the theory. Occam’s famous principle, expressed eight centuries ago, is to prefer
models that make the fewest assumptions, often measured in terms of the num­
ber of parameters or variables needed to make a prediction.271[Bus] 272[Phil] 273[Com]

5.3.3 Identifying Properties
Once the purposes of description have been established, we need to identify the
specific properties of the resources that can satisfy those purposes. There are
four reasons why this task is more difficult than it initially appears.
• First, any particular resource might need many resource descriptions, all of
which relate to different properties, depending on the interactions to be sup­
ported and the context in which they take place. Selecting people for a bas­
ketball team focuses on their physical properties such as height, strength,
leaping ability, and coordination. Selections for a debate team will be more
concerned with their verbal and intellectual properties.
• Second, different types of resources need to incorporate different properties
in their descriptions. For resources in a museum, these might include mate­
rials and dimensions of pieces of art; for files and services managed by a
network administrator, these include access control permissions; for elec­
tronic books or DVDs, they would include the digital rights management
(DRM) code that expresses what you can and cannot do with the resource.
• Third, as we briefly touched on in §5.3.1.3, which properties participate in
resource descriptions depends on who is doing the describing. It makes little
sense to expect fine-grained distinctions and interpretations about proper­
ties from people who lack training in the discipline of organizing. We will re­
turn to this tradeoff in §5.3.6 and again in §5.4.1.
• Fourth, what might seem to be the same property at a conceptual level
might be very different at an implementation level. Many resources have a
resource description that is a surrogate or summary of the primary re­
source. For photos, paintings, and other resources whose appearance is
their essence, an appropriate summary description can be a smaller, re­
duced resolution photo of the original. This surrogate is simple to create and
easy for users to relate to the primary resource. On the other hand, distilling
a text down to a short summary or abstract is a skill unto itself. Time-based
resources provide greater challenges for summary. Should the summary of a

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

241

The Discipline of Organizing

movie be a textual summary of the plot, a significant clip from the movie, a
video summary, or something else altogether?
This implementation gap is often very large for properties about people be­
cause people are not as easy to measure as most types of resources. Busi­
nesses need to quantify a person’s interest in their products to predict what
price they would be willing to pay, but “interest” cannot be measured direct­
ly. Instead, predictions rely on proxy measures for “interest” like how long
the customer looked at the product web page and whether they also looked
at a competitor’s web page.
Two important dimensions for understanding and contrasting resource proper­
ties used in descriptions and organizing principles are: property essence—
whether the properties are intrinsically or extrinsically associated with the re­
source, and; property persistence—whether the properties are static or dynam­
ic. Taken together these two dimensions yield four categories of properties, as
illustrated in Figure 5.4, Property Essence x Persistence: Four Categories of Prop­
erties. These four categories provide a useful framework for thinking about re­
source properties, even if, at times, the classification of properties is debata­
ble.274[CogSci]

5.3.3.1 Intrinsic Static Properties
Intrinsic or implicit properties are inherent in the resource and can often be di­
rectly perceived or experienced. Static properties do not change their values
over time. The species of an animal, the material of composition of a wooden
chair, and the diameter of a wheel are all static properties that do not change
their values over time. Static properties like color or shape are often used to de­
scribe and organize physical resources.
Intrinsic physical properties are usually just part of resource descriptions. In
many cases, physical properties describe only the surface layer of a resource,
revealing little about what something is or its original intended purpose, what it
means, or when and why it was created. The author of a song and the context of
its creation are other examples of intrinsic and static resource properties that
are not directly perceivable.
Intrinsic descriptions are often extracted or calculated by computational pro­
cesses. For example, a computer program might calculate the frequency and
distribution of words in some particular document. Similarly, visual signatures
or audio fingerprints are intrinsic descriptions (§5.4 Describing Non-text Resour­
ces (page 257)).
Some relationships among resources are intrinsic and static, like the parentchild relationship or the sibling relationship between two children with the
same parents. Part-whole or compositional relationships for resources with

Properties.

parts are also intrinsic static properties often used in resource descriptions.
However, it is better to avoid treating resource relationships as properties, and
instead express them as relations. Chapter 6, Describing Relationships and
Structures discusses part-whole and other semantic relationships in great detail.

Intrinsic Static Properties
Define a Dalmatian
The spots on a Dalmatian dog are
intrinsic static properties that ap­
pear shortly after birth, and they
are so distinctive that it is impossi­
ble to describe the breed without
acknowledging the spots.

5.3.3.2 Extrinsic Static Properties
Extrinsic or explicit properties are as­
signed to a resource rather than be­
ing inherent in it. The name or identi­
fier of a resource is often arbitrary
but once assigned does not usually
change. Arranging resources accord­
ing to the alphabetical or numerical
order of their descriptive identifiers is
a common organizing principle. Clas­
sification numbers and subject head­
ings assigned to bibliographic resour­
ces are extrinsic static properties, as
are the serial numbers stamped on or
attached to manufactured products.

For information resources that have a
digital form, the properties of their
printed or rendered versions might
not be intrinsic. Some text formats

in any way. For example, were a dif­
ferent style applied to this paragraph
to highlight it in bold or cast in 24-point font, its content would remain the
same.

5.3.3.3 Intrinsic Dynamic Properties
Intrinsic dynamic properties change over time. Developmental personal charac­
teristics like a person’s height and weight, skill proficiency, or intellectual ca­
pacity, for example. Because these properties are not static, they are usually
employed only to organize resources whose membership in the collection is of
limited duration. Sports programs or leagues that segregate participants by age
or years of experience are using intrinsic dynamic properties to describe and or­
ganize the resources.

244

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

5.3.3.4 Extrinsic Dynamic Properties
Extrinsic dynamic properties are in many ways arbitrary and can change be­
cause they are based on usage, behavior, or context. The current owner or loca­
tion of a resource, its frequency of access, the joint frequency of access with
other resources, its current popularity or cultural salience, or its competitive
advantage over alternative resources are typical extrinsic and dynamic proper­
ties that are used in resource descriptions. A topical book described as a best
seller one year might be found in the discount sales bin a few years later. A stu­
dent’s grade point average is an extrinsic dynamic property.
Extrinsic dynamic properties are useful features for data scientists making pre­
diction or classification models. Your current location, the thing you just bought,
and the place you bought it can be viewed as manifestations of unobservable
preferences and values. Fingerprints found on a doorknob at a crime scene are
an extrinsic dynamic property associated with the door, and clever detectives
would analyze them along with other interaction resources they discovered with
the goal of identifying the person for whom the fingerprints are intrinsic static
properties.
Many relationships between resources are extrinsic and dynamic properties,
like that of best friend.
Contextual properties are those related to the situation or context in which a re­
source is described. Dey defines context as “any information that characterizes
a situation related to the interactions between users, applications, and the sur­
rounding environment.” 275[Com] This open-ended definition implies a large num­
ber of contextual properties that might be used in a description; crisper defini­
tions of context might be “location + activity” or “who, when, where, why.”
Since context changes, context-based descriptors might be appropriate when
assigned but can have limited persistence and effectivity (§4.5 Resources over
Time (page 198)); the description of a document as “receipt of a recent pur­
chase” will not be useful for very long.
Citations of one information resource by another are extrinsic static descrip­
tions when they are in print form, but when they are published in digital libra­
ries it is usually the case that “cited by” is a dynamic resource description. Simi­
larly, any particular link from one web page to another is an extrinsic static de­
scription, but because many web pages themselves are highly dynamic, we can
also consider links as dynamic as well. Citations and web links are discussed in
more detail in Chapter 6.
Resources are often described with cultural properties that derive from conven­
tional language or culture, often by analogy, because they can be highly evoca­
tive and memorable. 277[Ling]

Why are Ottoman Carpets
Named After a German
Painter?

An example of a cultural category
that has far outlasted its motivation
is that of the Holbein carpet. A par­
ticular type of geometrically pat­
terned Ottoman rug came to be
known as a “Holbein carpet” after
the German Renaissance painter
Hans Holbein, who often depicted
the rugs in his work (probably to
show off his extremely meticulous
technique). Holbein was famous in
his time, and his commissioned
paintings of the English King Henry
VIII have Henry standing on such
rugs. This painting, called “The Am­
bassadors,” was painted in 1533
and now hangs in The National Gal­
lery, London.

Latent Feature Creation and
Netflix Recommendations
Recent advances in computing
technology and data science tech­
niques are making it possible to
discover or create resource prop­
erties that are called “latent” be­
cause they are inferred rather
than observed. Many such fea­
tures are used by businesses to
segment customers or make rec­
ommendations to them based on
their recent behavior, so these
features are also extrinsic and dy­
namic.

that easy to identify properties
like sex and age do not differenti­
ate movie watchers enough to
make
good
recommendations,
even if you combine them to cre­
ate a category like “single male

Netflix found that it was necessa­
ry to combine demographic prop­
erties, viewing history, and brows­
ing behavior with very detailed
ratings of dozens of movie proper­
ties to make good recommenda­
tions. It takes enormous comput­
ing power to discover a category
of Netflix users who typically like
action movies, yet consistently
hover their mouse over romance
movies, and to use this latent fea­
ture to recommend a sub-genre of
western movies (one of nearly
100,000) that it calls “Romantic
Action Adventure Movies.”276[Com]

For the Lego boys, current with the latest Star Wars movies, “light saber” was
just the obvious description for a long, neon tube with a handle. However, some­
one unfamiliar with the Star Wars franchise might not understand“light saber,”
and would describe the piece some other way.

5.3.4 Designing the Description Vocabulary
After we have determined the properties to use in resource descriptions, we
need to design the description vocabulary: the set of words or values that repre­
sent the properties. §4.4 Naming Resources (page 188) discussed the problems
of naming and proposed principles for good names, and since names are a very
important resource description, much of what we said there applies generally to
the design of the description vocabulary.
However, because the description vocabulary as a whole is much more than just
the resource name, we need to propose additional principles or guidelines for
this step. In addition, some new design questions arise when we consider all the
resource descriptions as a set whose separate descriptions are created by many
people over some period of time.

5.3.4.1 Principles of Good Description
In The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization, Svenonius proposes
a set of principles or “directives for design” of a description language. Her prin­
ciples, framed in the narrow context of bibliographic descriptions, generally ap­
ply to the broad range of resource types we consider in this book.
User Convenience
Choose description terms with the user in mind; these are likely to be terms
in common usage among the target audience.

Use descriptions that reflect how the resources describe themselves; assume
that self-descriptions are accurate.
Sufficiency and Necessity
Descriptions should have enough information to serve their purposes and
not contain information that is not necessary for some purpose; this might
imply excluding some aspects of self-descriptions that are insignificant.
Standardization
Standardize descriptions to the extent practical, but also use aliasing to al­
low for commonly used terms.
Integration
Prefer the same properties and terms for all types of resources.

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

247

The Discipline of Organizing

Any set of general design principles faces two challenges.
• The first is that implementing any principle requires many additional and
specific context-dependent choices for which the general principle offers lit­
tle guidance. For example, how does the principle of Standardization apply if
multiple standards already exist in some resource domain? Which of the
competing standards should be adopted, and why?
• The second challenge is that the general principles can sometimes lead to
conflicting advice. The User Convenience recommendation to choose de­
scription terms in common use fails if the user community includes both or­
dinary people and scientists who use different terms for the same resources;
whose “common usage” should prevail?

5.3.4.2 Who Uses the Descriptions?
Focus on the user of the descriptions. This is a core idea that we cannot overem­
phasize because it is implicit in every step of the process of resource descrip­
tion. All of the design principles in the previous section share the idea that the
design of the description vocabulary should focus on the user of the descrip­
tions. Are the resources being organized personal ones, for personal and mostly
private purposes? In that case, the description properties and terms can be
highly personal or idiosyncratic and still follow the design principles.
Similarly, when resource users share relevant knowledge, or are in a context
where they can communicate and negotiate, if necessary, to identify the resour­
ces, their resource descriptions can afford to be less precise and rigorous than
they might otherwise need to be. This helps explain the curious descriptions in
the Lego story with which we began this chapter. The boys playing with the
blocks were talking to each other with the Legos in front of them. If they had
not been able to see the blocks the others were talking about, or if they had to
describe their toys to someone who had never played with Legos before, their
descriptions would have been quite different.
More often, however, resource descriptions can not assume this degree of
shared context and must be designed for user categories rather than individual
users: library users searching for books, business employees or customers using
part and product catalogs, scientists analyzing the datasets from experiments or
simulations. In each of these situations resource descriptions will need to be un­
derstood by people who did not create them, so the design of the description vo­
cabulary needs to be more deliberate and systematic to ensure that its terms
are unambiguous and sufficient to ensure reliable context-free interpretation. A
single individual seldom has the breadth of domain knowledge and experience
with users needed to devise a description vocabulary that can satisfy diverse
users with diverse purposes. Instead, many people working together typically

cabularies, to contrast them with individual or cultural ones. (We will discuss
this contrast more fully in Chapter 7, Categorization: Describing Resource

5.3.4.3 Controlled Vocabularies and Content Rules
As we defined in §4.4.3.2, a controlled vocabulary is a fixed or closed set of de­
scription terms in some domain with precise definitions that is used instead of
the vocabulary that people would otherwise use. For example, instead of the
popular terms for descriptions of diseases or symptoms, medical researchers
and teaching hospitals can use the National Library of Medicine’s Medical Sub­
ject Headings (MeSH) controlled vocabulary.
We can distinguish a progression of vocabulary control: a glossary is a set of al­
lowed terms; a thesaurus is a set of terms arranged in a hierarchy and annota­
ted to indicate terms that are preferred, broader than, or narrower than other
terms; an ontology expresses the conceptual relationships among the terms in a
formal logic-based language so they can be processed by computers. We will say
more about ontologies in Chapter 6.
Content rules are similar to controlled vocabularies because they also limit the
possible values that can be used in descriptions. Instead of specifying a fixed set
of values, content rules typically restrict descriptions by requiring them to be of
a particular data type (integer, Boolean, Date, and so on). Possible values are
constrained by logical expressions (e.g., a value must be between 0 and 99) or

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

249

The Discipline of Organizing

regular expressions (e.g., must be a string of length 5 that must begin with a
number). Content rules like these are used to ensure valid descriptions when
people enter them in web forms or other applications.

5.3.4.4 Vocabulary Control as Dimensionality Reduction
In most cases, a controlled vocabulary is a subset of the natural or uncontrolled
vocabulary, but sometimes it is a new set of invented terms. This might sound
odd until we consider that the goal of a controlled vocabulary is to reduce the
number of descriptive terms assignable to a resource. Stated this way the prob­
lem is one of dimensionality reduction, transforming a high-dimensional space
into a lower-dimensional one. Reducing the number of components in a multidi­
mensional description can be accomplished by many different statistical techni­
ques that go by names like “feature extraction,” “principle components analy­
sis,” “orthogonal decomposition,” “latent semantic analysis,” “multidimensional
scaling,” and “factor analysis.” 282[DS]
These techniques might sound imposing and they are computationally complex,
but they all have the same simple concept at their core, that the features or
properties that describe some resource are often highly correlated. For exam­
ple, a document that contains the word “car” is more likely to contain the words
“driver” and “traffic” than a document that does not. Similar correlations exist
among the visual features used to describe images and the acoustic features
that describe music. Dimensionality reduction techniques analyze the correla­
tions between resource descriptions to transform a large set of descriptions into
a much smaller set of uncorrelated ones. In a way this implements the principle
of Sufficiency and Necessity we mentioned in §5.3.4.1 Principles of Good De­
scription (page 247) because it eliminates description dimensions or properties
that do not contribute much to distinguishing the resources.
Here is an oversimplified example that illustrates the idea. Suppose we have a
collection of resources, and every resource described as “big” is also described
as “red,” and every “small” resource is also “green.” This perfect correlation be­
tween color and size means that either of these properties is sufficient to distin­
guish “big red” things from “small green” ones, and we do not need clever algo­
rithms to figure that out. But if we have thousands of properties and the correla­
tions are only partial, we need the sophisticated statistical approaches to
choose the optimal set of description properties and terms, and in some techni­
ques the dimensions that remain are called “latent” or “synthetic” ones because
they are statistically optimal but do not map directly to resource properties.

5.3.5 Designing the Description Form
By this step in the process of resource description we have made numerous im­
portant decisions about which resources to describe, the purposes for which we
are describing, them, and the properties and terms we will use in the descrip­
tions. As much as possible we have described the steps at a conceptual level
and postponed discussion of implementation considerations about the notation,
syntax, and deployment of the resource descriptions separately or in packages.
Separating design from implementation concerns is an idealization of the proc­
ess of resource description, but is easier to learn and think about resource de­
scription and organizing systems if we do. We discuss these implementation is­
sues in Chapter 9, The Forms of Resource Descriptions.
Sometimes we have to confront legacy technology, existing or potential business
relationships, regulations, standards conformance, performance requirements,
or other factors that have implications for how resource descriptions must or
should be implemented, stored, and managed. We will take this more pragmatic
perspective in Chapter 11, The Organizing System Roadmap, but until then, we
will continue to focus on design issues and defer discussion of the implementa­
tion choices.

5.3.6 Creating Resource Descriptions
Resource descriptions can be created by professionals, by the authors or crea­
tors of resources, by users, or by computational or automated means.
Professionally-created resource descriptions, author- or user-created descrip­
tions, and computational or automated descriptions each have strengths and
limitations that impose tradeoffs. A natural solution is to try to combine desira­
ble aspects from each in hybrid approaches. For example, the vocabulary for a
new resource domain may arise from tagging by end users but then be refined
by professionals, lay classifiers may create descriptions with help from software
tools that suggest possible terms, or software that creates descriptions can be
improved by training it with human-generated descriptions, a form of super­
vised learning (see §7.5.3.3).
Often existing resource descriptions can or must be transformed or enhanced to
meet the ongoing needs of an organizing system, and sometimes these process­
es can be automated. We will defer further discussion of those situations to
Chapter 10, Interactions with Resources. In the discussion that follows we focus
on the creation of new resource descriptions where none yet exist.

5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

251

The Discipline of Organizing

5.3.6.1 Resource Description by Professionals
Before the web made it possible for almost anyone to create, publish, and de­
scribe their own resources and to describe those created and published by oth­
ers, resource description was generally done by professionals in institutional
contexts. Professional indexers and catalogers described bibliographic and mu­
seum resources after having been trained to learn the concepts, controlled de­
scriptive vocabularies, and the relevant standards. In information systems do­
mains professional data and process analysts, technical writers, and others cre­
ated similarly rigorous descriptions after receiving analogous training. We have
called these types of resource descriptions institutional ones to highlight the
contrast between those created according to standards and those created infor­
mally in ad hoc ways, especially by untrained or undisciplined individuals.285[Bus]

5.3.6.2 Resource Description by Authors or Creators
The author or creator of a resource can be presumed to understand the reasons
why and the purposes for which the resource can be used. And, presumably,
most authors want to be read, so they will describe their resources in ways that
will appeal to and be useful to their intended users. However, these descriptions
are unlikely to use the controlled vocabularies and standards that professional
catalogers would use.

5.3.6.3 Resource Description by Users
Today’s web contains a staggering number of resources, most of which are pri­
mary information resources published as web content, but many others are re­
sources that stand for “in the world” physical resources. Most of these resour­
ces are being described by their users rather than by professionals or by their
authors. These “at large” users are most often creating descriptions for their
own benefit when they assign tags or ratings to web resources, and they are un­
likely to use standard or controlled descriptors when they do so. The resulting
variability can be a problem if creating the description requires judgment on the
tagger’s part. Most people can agree on the length of a particular music file but
they may differ wildly when it comes to determining to which musical genre that
file belongs. Fortunately most web users implicitly recognize that the potential
value in these “Web 2.0” or “user-generated content” applications will be great­
er if they avoid egocentric descriptions. In addition, the statistics of large sam­
ple sizes inevitably leads to some agreement in descriptions on the most popu­
lar applications because idiosyncratic descriptions are dominated in the fre­
quency distribution by the more conventional ones.287[Web]
We are not suggesting that professional descriptions are always of high quality
and utility, and socially produced ones are always of low quality and utili­
ty.288[CogSci] Rather, it is important to understand the limitations and
252

qualifications of descriptions pro­
duced in each way. Tagging lowers
the barrier to entry for description,
making organizing more accessible
and creating descriptions that reflects
a variety of viewpoints. However,
when many tags are associated with a
resource, it increases recall while de­
creasing precision. (See §5.3.6.3 Re­
source Description by Users (page
252))

5.3.6.4 Automated and
Computational Resource
Description

Metacrap
In an often-cited essay (Doctorow
2001) provocatively titled “Meta­
crap: Putting the torch to seven
straw-men of the meta-utopia,” Co­
ry Doctorow argues that much
human-created metadata is of low
quality because “people lie, people
are lazy, people are stupid, mission
impossible—know thyself, schemas
are not neutral, metrics influence
results, (and) there is more than
one way to describe something.”

A picture’s EXIF file created by a digital camera records properties associated
with the camera and its settings, as well as some properties of the photo-taking
context. (See Figure 5.6, Contrasting Descriptions for a Work of Art. for an exam­
ple.) Creating this highly detailed description by hand would be nearly impossi­
ble. The downside, however, is that the automated description does not capture
the meaning of the photo; an automated picture description captures the time
and place, but not that it is a picture of a honeymoon vacation. The difference
between automated and human description is called the semantic gap (§4.4.2.5).
Any resource that is smart enough to collect data about its state or environment
is creating resource descriptions automatically (See §4.2.3.2). Resources with
computational capabilities can process the raw sensor data to identify important
events and create more interpretable descriptions.
Some computational approaches create resource descriptions that are similar in
purpose to those created by human describers. Text mining and summarization
systems for customer comments about products can reduce thousands of com­
ments to a list of the most important features.289[Com] People shopping for books
at Amazon.com get insights about a book’s content and distinctiveness from the
statistically improbable phrases that it has identified by comparing all the books
for which it has the complete text.290[Com]
Computational descriptions can use any observable or latent variable (see the
sidebar, Latent Feature Creation and Netflix Recommendations (page 246)) ex­
cept some that are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, national origin, and
marital status, to prevent discrimination. In practice, however, this prohibition
is easily circumvented because these properties can usually be predicted using
other ones. For example, race can often be reliably predicted using residence
address and surname.291[DS]
5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

253

The Discipline of Organizing

Of course, all information retrieval systems compare a description of a user’s
needs with descriptions of the resources that might satisfy them. IR systems dif­
fer in the resource properties they emphasize; word frequencies and distribu­
tions for documents in digital libraries, links and navigation behavior for web
pages, acoustics for music, and so on. These different property descriptions de­
termine the comparison algorithms and the way in which relevance or similarity
of descriptions is determined. We say a lot more about this in §5.4 Describing
Non-text Resources (page 257) and in Chapter 10.

5.3.7 Evaluating Resource Descriptions
Evaluation is implicit in many of the activities of organizing systems we descri­
bed in Chapter 3, Activities in Organizing Systems and is explicit when we main­
tain a collection of resources over time. In this section, we focus on the narrow­
er problem of evaluating resource descriptions.
Evaluating means determining quality with respect to some criteria or dimen­
sions. Many different sets of criteria have been proposed; for repositories of dig­
ital resources, the most commonly used ones are accuracy, completeness, and
consistency. Other typical criteria are timeliness, interoperability, and usability.
It is easy to imagine these criteria in conflict; efforts to achieve accuracy and
completeness might jeopardize timeliness; enforcing consistency might pre­
clude modifications and personalizations that would enhance usability.

5.3.7.1 Evaluating the Creation of Resource Descriptions
When professionals create resource descriptions in a centralized manner, which
has long been the standard practice for many resources in libraries, there is a
natural focus on quality at the point of creation to ensure that the appropriate
controlled vocabularies and standards have been used. However, the need for
resource description generalizes to resource domains outside of the traditional
bibliographic one, and other quality considerations emerge in those contexts.
Resource descriptions in private sector firms are essential to running the busi­
ness and in interacting efficiently with suppliers, partners, and customers. Com­
pared to the public sector, there is much greater emphasis on the economics
and strategy of resource description.293[Bus] What is the value of resource de­
scription? Who will bear the costs of producing them? Which of the competing
industry standards will be followed? Some of these decisions are not free
choices as much as they are constraints imposed as a condition of doing busi­
ness with a dominant economic partner, which is sometimes a governmental en­
tity.
For example, a firm like Wal-Mart with enormous market power can dictate
terms and standards to its suppliers because the long-term benefits of a WalMart contract usually make the initial accommodation worthwhile. Likewise,
governments often require their suppliers to conform to open standards to avoid
lock-in to proprietary technologies. 294[Bus]
In both the public and private sectors there is increased use of computational
techniques for creating resource descriptions because the number of resources
to be described is simply too great to allow for professional description. A great
deal of work in text data mining, web page classification, semantic enrichment,
and other similar research areas is already under way and is significantly lower­
ing the cost of producing useful resource descriptions. Some museums have em­
braced approaches that automatically create user-oriented resource descrip­
tions and new user interfaces for searching and browsing by transforming the
professional descriptions in their internal collections management systems.
Google’s ambitious project to digitize millions of books has been criticized for
the quality of its algorithmically extracted resource descriptions, but we can ex­
pect that computer scientists will put the Google book corpus to good use as a
research test bed to improve the techniques.296[Com]
Web 2.0 applications that derive their value from the aggregation and interpre­
tation of user-generated content can be viewed as voluntarily ceding their au­
thority to describe and organize resources to their users, who then tag or rate
them as they see fit. In this context the consistency of resource description, or
the lack of it, becomes an important issue, and many sites are using technology
or incentives to guide users to create better descriptions.
5.3 The Process of Describing Resources

255

The Discipline of Organizing

5.3.7.2 Evaluating the Use of Resource Descriptions
Regardless of, or in addition to, any quality criteria applied to the creation and
selection of resource descriptions, at some point the resource descriptions meet
their intended users. The most important quality criterion at that point is wheth­
er the resource descriptions satisfy their intended purposes in a usable way. In
many ways, the answer is a disappointing no.
For example, in one of the earliest revisions to the original HTML specification,
a <META> tag was added to allow creators of web resources to define a set of
key terms to describe a website or web page. This well-motivated resource de­
scription was to be used by search engines to improve the relevance of re­
trieved pages. However, it soon became obvious that it was possible to “game”
the META tag by adding popular terms even though they did not accurately de­
scribe the page. Today search engines ignore the <META> tag for ranking pages,
but many other techniques that use false resource descriptions continue to pla­
gue web users. (See §3.5.3.3.)
The design of a description vocabulary circumscribes what can be said about a
resource, so it is important to recognize that it implicitly determines what can­
not be said as well, with unintended negative consequences for users. The re­
source description schema implemented in a physician’s patient management
system defines certain types of recordable information about a patient’s visit—
the date of the visit, any tests that were ordered, a diagnosis that was made, a
referral to a specialist. The schema, and its associated workflow, impose con­
straints that affect the kinds of information medical professionals can record
and the amount of space they can use for those descriptions. Moreover, such a
schema might also eliminate vital unstructured space that paper records can
provide, where doctors communicate their rationale for a diagnosis or decision
without having to fit it into any particular box.
However, when resource descriptions are the data used to train models for pre­
diction or classification, the focus of evaluation is not on the descriptions, which
are often assumed to be accurate observations about the world. Instead, evalua­
tion focuses on the model, and “model selection” is the task of choosing which
of several competing models best fit the original data while also generalizing
well to new data. In any event, any quality problems or selection biases with the
original data will undermine the value of whatever model is selected.

256

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

5.3.7.3 The Importance of Iterative Evaluation
The inevitable conflicts between quality goals mean that there will be compro­
mises among the quality criteria. Furthermore, increasing scale in an organiz­
ing system and the steady improvements of computational techniques for re­
source description imply that the nature of the compromise will change over
time. As a result, a single evaluation of resource descriptions at one moment in
time will not suffice.
This makes usage records, navigation history, and transactional data extremely
important kinds of resource descriptions because they enable you to focus ef­
forts on improving quality where they are most needed. Furthermore, for organ­
izing systems with many types of resources and user communities, this informa­
tion can enable the tailoring of the nature and extent of resource description to
find the right balance between “rich and comprehensive” and “simple and effi­
cient” approaches. Each combination of resource type and user community
might have a different solution.
The idea that quality is a property of an end-to-end process is embodied in the
“quality movement” and statistical process control for industrial processes but
it applies equally well to resource description. The central idea is that quality
cannot be tested in by inspecting the final products. Instead, quality is achieved
through process control—measuring and removing the variability of every proc­
ess needed to create the products.297[Bus] Explicit feedback from users or implicit
feedback from the records of their resource interactions needs are essential as
we iterate through the design process and revisit the decisions made there.

5.4 Describing Non-text Resources
Many of the principles and methods for resource description were developed for
describing text resources in physical formats. Those principles have had to
evolve to deal with different types of resources that people want to describe and
organize, from paintings and statues to MP3s, JPEGs, and MPEGs.
Some descriptions for non-text resources are text-based, and are most often as­
signed by people. Other descriptions are in non-text formats are extracted algo­
rithmically from the content of the non-text resource. These latter contentbased resource descriptions capture intrinsic technical properties and in some
domains are able to describe aboutness with some accuracy, thanks to break­
throughs in machine learning.

5.4 Describing Non-text Resources

257

The Discipline of Organizing

5.4.1 Describing Museum and Artistic Resources
The problems associated with describing multimedia resources are not all new.
Museum curators have been grappling with them since they first started to col­
lect, store, and describe artifacts hundreds of years ago. Many artifacts may
represent the same work (think about shards of pottery that may once have
been part of the same vase). The materials and forms do not convey semantics
on their own. Without additional research and description, we know nothing
about the vase; it does not come with any sort of title page or tag that connects
it with a 9th-century Mayan settlement. Since museums can acquire large
batches of artifacts all at once, they have to make decisions about which resour­
ces they can afford to describe and how much they can describe them.
German art historian Erwin Panofsky first codified one approach to these prob­
lems of description. In his classic Studies in Iconology, he defined three levels of
description that can be applied to an artistic work or museum artifact. Fig­
ure 5.6, Contrasting Descriptions for a Work of Art. contrasts these three levels in
the descriptions of a marble statue. It also shows the striking differences be­
tween the EXIF description in a digital photo of the statue and those created by
people.

5.4.2 Describing Images
Digital cameras, including those in cell phones, take millions of photos each day.
Unlike the images in museums and galleries, most of these images receive few
descriptions beyond those created by the device that made them. Nevertheless,
a great many of them end up with some limited descriptions in Facebook, Insta­
gram, Flickr, Picasa, DeviantArt, or others of the numerous places where people
share images, or in professional image applications like Light Room. All of these
sites provide some facilities for users to assign tags to images or arrange them
in named groups.
Many different computational approaches have been used to describe or classify
images. One approach uses the visual signature of an image extracted from lowlevel features like color, shape, texture, and luminosity, which are then used to
distinguish significant regions and objects. Image similarity is computed to cre­
ate categories of images that contain the same kinds of colors, objects, or set­
tings, which makes it easy to find duplicate or modified images.300[Com]
For computers to identify specific objects or people in images, it is logically nec­
essary to train them with images that are already identified. In 2005 Luis van
Ahn devised a clever way to collect large amounts of labeled images with a webbased game called ESP that randomly paired people to suggest labels or tags
for an image. The obvious choices were removed from contention, so a photo of
a bird against a blue sky might already strike “bird” and “sky” from the set of

Figure 5.6. Contrasting Descriptions for a Work of Art.

Descriptions for works of art can contrast a great deal, especially between those
captured by a device like a digital camera and those created by people. Further­
more, the descriptions created by people differ according to the expertise of the
creator and the amount of subjective interpretation applied in the description.

acceptable words, leaving users to suggest words such as “flying” and “cloud­
less.” Van Ahn also invented the reCAPTCHA technique that presents images of
text from old books being digitized, which improves the accuracy of the digitiza­
tion while verifying that the user of a web site is a person and not a robot pro­
gram.301[Web]
5.4 Describing Non-text Resources

259

The Discipline of Organizing

However, if short text descriptions or low-level image properties are the only
features available to train an image, otherwise irrelevant variations in the posi­
tion, orientation, or illumination of objects in images will make it very difficult
to distinguish objects that look similar, like a white wolf and the wolf-like white
dog called a Samoyed. This problem can be addressed by using deep neural net­
works, which exploit the idea that low-level image features can be combined in­
to many layers of higher-level ones; edges combine to form motifs or patterns,
patterns combine to form parts of familiar objects, and parts combine to form
complete objects. This hierarchical composition enables the highest-level repre­
sentations to become insensitive to the lower-level variations that plague the
other approaches.
In 2012, when deep learning techniques were applied to a dataset of about a
million images that contained a thousand different object categories, they re­
duced the error rate by half. This spectacular breakthrough, and the fact that
the deep learning techniques that derive layers of features from the input data
are completely general, rapidly caused deep learning to be applied to many oth­
er domains with high-dimensional data. Facebook uses deep learning to identify
people in photos, Google uses it for speech recognition and language transla­
tion, and rapid captioning for images and video are on the horizon. Wearable
computers might use it to layer useful information onto people's views of the
world, creating real-time augmented reality.302[Com]

5.4.3 Describing Music
Some parts of describing a song are not that different from describing text: You
might want to pull out the name of the singer and/or the songwriter, the length
of the song, or the name of the album on which it appears. But what if you wan­
ted to describe the actual content of the song? You could write out the lyrics,
but describing the music itself requires a different approach.
Describing music presents challenges quite different from those involved in de­
scribing texts or images. Poems and paintings are tangible things that we can
look at and contemplate, while the aural nature of music means that it is a fleet­
ing phenomenon that can only be experienced in the performative moment.
Even musical scores and recordings, while as much tangible things as paintings
and poems, are merely containers that hold the potential for musical experience
and not the music itself. Most contemporary popular music is in the form of
songs, in which texts are set to a melody and supported by instrumental harmo­
nies. If we want to categorize or describe such music by its lyrical content, we
can still rely on methods for describing texts. But if we want to describe the mu­
sic itself, we need to take a somewhat different approach.

260

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

Several people and companies work­
ing in multimedia have explored dif­
ferent processes for how songs are
described. On the heavily technologi­
cal side, software applications such as
Shazam and Midomi can create a
content-based audio fingerprint from
a snippet of music. Audio fingerprint­
ing renders a digital description of a
piece of music, which a computer can
then interpret and compare to other
digital descriptions in a library.303[Com]
On the face of it, contemporary music
streaming services represent the apex
of music classification and descrip­
tion. Pandora, for example, employs
trained musicologists to listen to the
music and then categorize the genres
and musical materials according to a
highly controlled musical vocabulary.
The resulting algorithm, the “Music
Genome,” can essentially learn to de­

A DJ Describes and Organizes
Music

Casual music fans might describe
their music using the names of the
songs or performers and might organ­
ize it according to genres like “Pop,”
“Rock,” or “Classical.” A professional
DJ, however, emphasizes different
properties, especially the beats per
minute of the music.
This annotated photo shows a portion
of the music collection of noted DJ
“Kid
Kameleon”
(http://kidkame­
leon.com/ ).

But musicians have been thinking
about how to describe music for centuries, and while the Music Genome cer­
tainly brims with complexity, it pales in comparison to the sophistication of the
much older “pen-and-paper” methods from which it derives. Ethnomusicology
(loosely defined as the study of global musical practices in their social contexts)
has arguably made greater strides towards comprehensive descriptions of musi­
cal resources than any other field of musicological study. Since the late 19th
century, ethnomusicologists have created complex methods of notation and sty­
listic taxonomies to capture and categorize the music of both Western and nonWestern cultures.
On a more granular level, musicians are endlessly innovative in finding ways to
categorize, describe, and analyze not simply large-scale musical genres, but the
notes themselves. In the accompanying photo showing the record collection of
professional DJ “Kid Kameleon,” we see that the records are arranged not sim­
ply by genre, but also by beats-per-minute (BPM). For Kid Kameleon, these re­

cords represent the resources of his musical creative process, and arranging
them by BPM allows him to pull exactly the correct musical material he needs to
keep the music flowing during a performance. His classification system is there­
fore a taxonomy that moves from the broad strokes of genre down to the fine
grains of specific arrangements of notes and rhythms. This photo is not simply a
picture of a record collection: it is a visual representation of an artist’s creative
process.

5.4.4 Describing Video
Video is yet another resource domain where work to create resource descrip­
tions to make search more effective is ongoing. Video analytics techniques can
segment a video into shorter clips described according to their color, direction
of motion, size of objects, and other characteristics. Identifying anomalous
events and faces of people in video has obvious applications in security and sur­
veillance.307[Com] Identifying specific content details about a video currently
takes a significant amount of human intervention, though it is possible that im­
age signature-matching algorithms will take over in the future because they
would enable automated ad placement in videos and television.308[Bus]

5.5 Key Points in Chapter Five
• Information retrieval is characterized as comparing a description of a user’s
needs with descriptions of the resources that might satisfy them. Different
property descriptions determine the comparison algorithms and the way in
which relevance or similarity of descriptions is determined.
(See §5.2.1 Naming {and, or, vs.} Describing (page 219))
• In different contexts, the terms in resource descriptions are called key­
words, index terms, attributes, attribute values, elements, data elements,
data values, or “the vocabulary,” labels, or tags.
(See §5.2.2 “Description” as an Inclusive Term (page 220))
• In the library science context of bibliographic description, a descriptor is
one of the terms in a carefully designed language that can be assigned to a
resource to designate its properties, characteristics, or meaning, or its rela­
tionships with other resources.
(See §5.2.2 “Description” as an Inclusive Term (page 220))
• A bibliographic description of an information resource is most commonly re­
alized as a structured record in a standard format that describes a specific
resource.
(See §5.2.2.1 Bibliographic Descriptions (page 220))

262

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

• Metadata is structured description for information resources of any kind,
which makes it a superset of bibliographic description.
(See §5.2.2.2 Metadata (page 221))
• A relational database schema is designed to restrict resource descriptions to
be simple and completely regular sets of attribute-value pairs.
(See §5.2.2.2 Metadata (page 221))
• The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language for making
computer-processable statements about web resources that is the founda­
tion for the vision of the Semantic Web.
(See §5.2.2.4 Resource Description Framework (RDF) (page 223))
• An aggregation is a set of information objects that, when considered togeth­
er, compose another named information object.
(See §5.2.2.4 Resource Description Framework (RDF) (page 223))
• The dominant historical view treats resource descriptions as a package of
statements, an alternate framework focuses on each individual description
or assertion about a single resource.
(See §5.2.3 Frameworks for Resource Description (page 226))
• Design of the description vocabulary should focus on the user of the descrip­
tions. Svenonius proposes five principles for a description vocabulary: user
convenience, representation, sufficiency and necessity, standardization, and
integration.
(See §5.3 The Process of Describing Resources (page 227))
• The process of describing resources involves several interdependent and
iterative steps, including determining scope, focus and purposes, identifying
resource properties, designing the description vocabulary, designing the de­
scription form and implementation, and creating and evaluating the descrip­
tions.
(See §5.3 The Process of Describing Resources (page 227) and Figure 5.3, The
Process of Describing Resources.)
• A collection of resource descriptions is vastly more useful when every re­
source is described using common description elements or terms that apply
to every resource; this specification is most often called a schema or model.
(See §5.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Description (page 232))
• XML schemas are often used to define web forms that capture resource in­
stances, and are also used to describe the interfaces to web services and
other computational resources.
(See §5.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Description (page 232))

5.5 Key Points in Chapter Five

The Discipline of Organizing

• When the task of resource description is standardized, the work can be dis­
tributed among many describers whose results are shared. This is the princi­
ple on which centralized bibliographic description has been based for a cen­
tury.
(See §5.3.1.3 Scope, Scale, and Resource Description (page 232))
• Resource description can facilitate the discovery of resources, specify their
capabilities and compatibility, authenticate them, and indicate their ap­
praised value.
(See §5.3.2.1 Resource Description to Support Selection (page 234))
• The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) presents
four purposes that apply generically: Finding, Identifying, Selecting, and Ob­
taining resources.
(See §5.3.2.3 Resource Description to Support Interactions (page 236))
• The variety and functions of the interactions with digital resources depends
on the richness of their structural, semantic, and format description.
(See §5.3.2.3 Resource Description to Support Interactions (page 236))
• Sensemaking is the foundation of organizing, as it is the basic human activi­
ty of making sense of the world. Sensemaking encompasses the range of or­
ganizing activities from the very informal and personal to systematic scien­
tific processes.
(See §5.3.2.5 Resource Description for Sensemaking and Science (page 238))
• Any particular resource might need many resource descriptions, all of which
relate to different properties, depending on the interactions that need to be
supported and the context in which they take place.
(See §5.3.3 Identifying Properties (page 241))
• Two important dimensions for understanding and contrasting resource prop­
erties are whether the properties are intrinsically or extrinsically associated
with the resource, and whether the properties are static or dynamic.
(See §5.3.3 Identifying Properties (page 241))
• Recent advances in computing technology and data science techniques are
making it possible to discover or create resource properties that are called
“latent” because they are inferred rather than observed.
(See the sidebar, Latent Feature Creation and Netflix Recommendations
(page 246))
• A controlled vocabulary is a fixed or closed set of description terms in some
domain with precise definitions that is used instead of the vocabulary that
people would otherwise use. A controlled vocabulary reduces synonymy and
homonymy.
264

Chapter 5 — Resource Description and Metadata

Informatics Edition

• Professionally created resource descriptions, author or user created descrip­
tions, and computational or automated descriptions each have strengths and
limitations that impose tradeoffs.
(See §5.3.6 Creating Resource Descriptions (page 251))
• The most commonly used criteria for evaluating resource descriptions are
accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Other typical criteria are timeli­
ness, interoperability, and usability.
(See §5.3.7 Evaluating Resource Descriptions (page 254))
• Computational methods can describe and classify images, identify and clas­
sify sounds and music, and identify anomalous events in video.

This is much more than just a “kids say the darnedest things” story
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Say_the_Darndest_Things ). Giles Turnbull
(Turnbull 2009) noticed that his kids never used the official names for Lego
blocks (e.g., Brick 2x2). He then asked other kids what their names were for 32
types of Lego blocks. His survey showed that the kids mostly used different
names, but each created names that followed some systematic principles. The
most standard name was the “light saber,” used by every kid in Turnbull’s sam­

(Reaney and Wilson 1997) classify surnames as local, surnames of rela­

occupational names reflects the fact that there are fewer occupations than pla­

(patronymic or father-based names are most common), because the surname in­
cludes the father’s name there is more variation than for occupations.

See (Sen 2004), (Laskey 2005).

See (Marlow, Naaman, Boyd, and Davis 2006). These authors propose a
conceptual model of tagging that includes (1) tags assigned to a specific re­
source, (2) connections or links between resources, and (3) connections or links
between users and explain how any two of these can be used to infer informa­
tion about the other.
[237][IA]

(Hammond, Hanney, Lund, and Scott 2004) coined the phrase “tag soup”
in an review of social bookmarking tools written early in the tagging era that re­
mains insightful today. Many of the specific tools are no longer around, but the
reasons why people tag are still the same.
[238][IA]

Making tagging more systematic leads to “tag convergence” in which
the distribution of tags for a particular resource stabilizes over time (Golder and
Huberman 2006). Consider three things a user might do if his tag does not
match the suggested tags; (1) Change the tag to conform? (2) Keep the tag to
influence the group norm? (3) Add the proposed tag but keep his tag as well?

Because the relational database schema serves as a model for the crea­
tion of resource descriptions, it is designed to restrict the descriptions to be
simple and completely regular sets of attribute-value pairs. The database sche­
ma specifies the overall structure of the tables and especially their columns,
which will contain the attribute values that describe each resource. An employ­
ee table might have columns for the attributes of employee ID, hiring date, de­
partment, and salary. A date attribute will be restricted to a value that is a date,
while an employee salary will be restricted according to salary ranges establish­
ed by the human resources department. This makes the name of the attribute
and the constraints on attribute values into resource descriptions that apply to
the entire class of resources described by the table.

[251][Com]

It is often necessary to associate some descriptions with individual resources
that are specific to that instance and other kinds of descriptions that reflect the
abstract class to which the instance belongs. When a typical car comes off the
assembly line, it has only one instance-level description that differentiates it
from its peers: its vehicle identification number (VIN). Specific cars have indi­
vidualized interior and exterior colors and installed options, and they all have a
266

date and location of manufacture. Other description elements have values that
are shared with many other cars of the same model and year, like suggested
price and the additional option packages, or configurations that can be applied
to it before it is delivered to a customer. Alternatively, any descriptive informa­
tion that applies to multiple cars of the same model year could be part of a re­
source description at that level that is referred to rather than duplicated in in­
stance descriptions.
Web services are generally implemented using XML documents as their
inputs and outputs. The interfaces to web services are typically described using
an XML vocabulary called Web Services Description Language (WSDL). See (Erl

The semantic “bluntness” of a minimalist vocabulary is illustrated by

A similar principle is used in some sports; goalies wear different color jerseys to

distinctive practice jerseys to remind defensive players not to tackle them and
possibly injure them.
It is worth noting that color blindness affects approximately 7% of the popula­

The Creative Commons nonprofit organization defines six kinds of copy­

Using the same standards to describe products or to specify the execu­
tion of business processes can facilitate the implementation and operation of
information-intensive business models because information can then flow be­
tween services or firms without human intervention. In turn this enables the
business to become more demand or event-driven rather than forecast driven,
making it a more “adaptive,” “agile,” or “on demand” enterprise. See (Glushko

For new resources, the labor-intensive cost of traditional bibliographic
description is less justifiable when you can follow a link from a resource de­
scription to the digital resource it describes and quickly decide its relevance.
That is, web search engines demonstrate that algorithmic analysis of the con­

gree, reducing the need for bibliographic description.

Occam’s Razor has a long tradition in scientific philosophy, but some
people have argued that it is overrated as a heuristic for choosing among alter­
native explanations or theories, particularly because it depends on how you de­
fine simplicity.
[272][Phil]

One way to make simplicity more useful as a guide for choosing be­
tween mathematical models is to explicitly penalize those that are more com­
plex by adding error to the predictions, a technique that computer scientists
have given the non-intuitive name of regularization. This penalty requires com­
plex models to be significantly better at explaining the data than simpler ones
because they have to overcome the added errors.

For example, the composition of a chair is presented here as a static
intrinsic property but in fact a wooden chair might deteriorate over time as a re­
sult of exposure to sunlight, heat, or biological agents that attack it. A skill can
be considered intrinsic and dynamic, but it might also be highly dependent on
context, making it extrinsic. The subject category assigned to a book is extrinsic
and static, but if the classification system is revised the book might be reclassi­
fied. Finally, while the location of a resource can be extrinsic and dynamic, the
location history of the resource at some specific point in time is a fact, an intrin­
sic and static property.
[274][CogSci]

(Dey 2001) further defines the “environment” of context as places, peo­
ple, and things, and for each of “entities” there are four categories of context in­
formation: location, identity, status (or activity), and time. This framework thus
yields 12 dimensions for describing the context of an environment.

We cannot cite all of mathematical statistics in one short endnote, but if
you are inclined to learn more, (Mardia, Kent, and Bibby 1980) and (Lee and
Verleysen 2007) are the kindest and gentlest resources. If we look very gener­
ously at “dimensionality reduction” we might even consider the indexing step of
eliminating “stop words” to be a form of dimensionality reduction. Stop words
appear with such high frequency that they have no discriminating power, so
they are discarded from queries and not part of the description of the indexed
documents.

Many institutional organizing systems are subject to a single centralized
or governmental authority that can impose principles for describing and arrang­
ing resources. Examples of organizing systems where resources are described
using standard centralized principles are:

[285][Bus]

Companies that follow industry standards for information or process models,
product classification or identification to be eligible for government business
(Shah and Kesan 2006).
Legislative documents that conform to National or European Community stand­
ards for structure, naming, and description (Biasiotti 2008).
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and its
policies for operating the Domain Name System (DNS) make it possible for ev­
ery website to be located using its logical name (like “berkeley.edu” rather than
using an IP address like 169.229.131.81). ( http://www.icann.org/ )
In other domains multiple organizations or institutions have the authority to im­
pose principles of resource description. Sometimes this authority derives from
the voluntary collaboration of multiple autonomous parties who set and conform
to standards because they benefit from being able to share resources or infor­
mation about resources. Examples of organizing systems where resources are
described using standardized decentralized principles are:
Firms that establish company-wide standards for their information resources,
typically including the organization and management of source content, docu­
ment type models, and a style guide that applies to print and web documents.
Firms that participate in the OASIS ( http://www.oasis-open.org/ ) or the W3C

recommendations for their information systems or web services).

But in an often-cited essay (Doctorow, 2001) provocatively titled “Met­

More generally, economists use the concept of the “mode of exchange”
in a business relationship to include the procedures and norms that govern rou­
tine behavior between business partners. An “exit” mode is one in which the
buyer makes little long-term commitment to a supplier, and problems with a
supplier cause the buyer to find a new one. In contrast, in “voice” mode there is
much greater commitment and communication between the parties, usually
leading to improved processes and designs. See (Helper and McDuffie 2003).

video content is the United States’ National Football League (NFL), whose vast

appear on film. Currently, labeling the video requires a person to watch the
scenes and tag elements of each frame, but once those tags have been created
and sequenced along with the video, they can be more easily searched in com­
puterized, automated ways (Buhrmester 2007).

6.1 Introduction
We consider a family to be a collection of people affiliated by some connections,
such as common ancestors or a common residence. The Simpson family includes
a man named Homer and a woman named Marge, the married parents of three
sibling children, a boy named Bart and two girls, Lisa and Maggie. This magical
family speaks many languages, but most often uses the language of the local tel­
evision station. In the English-speaking Simpson family, the boy describes his
parents as his father and mother and his two siblings as his sisters. In the Span­
ish speaking Simpson family he refers to his parents as su padre y su madre and
his sisters are las hermanas. In the Chinese Simpson family the sisters refer to
each other according to their relative ages; Lisa, the elder, as jiě jie and, Mag­
gie, the younger, as mèi mei.309[Bus]

The Discipline of Organizing

Kinship relationships are ubiquitous and widely studied, and the names and sig­
nificance of kinship relations like “is parent of” or “is sibling of” are familiar
ones, making kinship a good starting point for understanding relationships in
organizing systems.310[CogSci] An organizing system can make use of existing rela­
tionships among resources, or it can create relationships by applying organizing
principles to arrange the resources. Organizing systems for digital resources or
digital description resources are the most likely to rely on explicit relationships
to enable interactions with the resources.
In a classic book called Data and Re­
ality, William Kent defines a relation­
ship as an association among several

common relationships to define resource types or classes, which more generally
are called categories (Chapter 7). We can then use resource types as one or both
the components of a relationship when we want to further describe the resource
type or to assert how two resource types go together to facilitate our interac­
tions with them.

We begin with a more complete definition of relationship and introduce five per­
spectives for analyzing them: semantic, lexical, structural, architectural, and im­
plementation. We then discuss each perspective, introducing the issues that
each emphasizes, and the specialized vocabulary needed to describe and ana­
lyze relationships from that point of view. We apply these perspectives and vo­
cabulary to analyze the most important types of relationships in organizing sys­
tems.

6.2 Describing Relationships: An Overview
The concept of a relationship is pervasive in human societies in both informal
and formal senses. Humans are inescapably related to generations of ancestors,
and in most cases they also have social networks of friends, co-workers, and
casual acquaintances to whom they are related in various ways. We often hear
that our access to information, money, jobs, and political power is all about
“who you know,” so we strive to “network” with other people to build relation­
ships that might help us expand our access. In information systems, relation­
ships between resources embody the organization that enables finding, selec­
tion, retrieval, and other interactions.
Most organizing systems are based on many relationships to enable the system
to satisfy some intentional purposes with individual resources or the collection
as a whole. In the domain of information resources, common resources include
web pages, journal articles, books, datasets, metadata records, and XML docu­
ments, among many others. Important relationships in the information domain
that facilitate purposes like finding, identifying, and selecting resources include
“is the author of,” “is published by,” “has publication date,” “is derived from,”
“has subject keyword,” “is related to,” and many others.
When we talk about relationships we specify both the resources that are associ­
ated along with a name or statement about the reason for the association. Just
identifying the resources involved is not enough because several different rela­
tionships can exist among the same resources; the same person can be your
brother, your employer, and your landlord. Furthermore, for many relationships
the directionality or ordering of the participants in a relationship statement
matters; the person who is your employer gives a paycheck to you, not vice ver­
sa. Kent points out that when we describe a relationship we sometimes use
whole phrases, such as “is-employed-by,” if our language does not contain a sin­
gle word that expresses the meaning of the relationship.

6.2 Describing Relationships: An Overview

The Discipline of Organizing

Navigating This Chapter
In this chapter, we analyze relationships from several different per­
spectives:
Semantic perspective
The semantic perspective is the most essential one; it character­
izes the meaning of the association between resources. (§6.3)

Lexical perspective
The lexical perspective focuses on how the conceptual descrip­
tion of a relationship is expressed using words in a specific lan­
guage. (§6.4)
Structural perspective
The structural perspective analyzes the actual patterns of associ­
ation, arrangement, proximity, or connection between resources.
(§6.5)
Architectural perspective
The architectural perspective emphasizes the number and ab­
straction level of the components of a relationship, which togeth­
er characterize its complexity. (§6.6)
Implementation perspective
The implementation perspective considers how the relationship is
implemented in a particular notation and syntax and the manner
in which relationships are arranged and stored in some technolo­
gy environment. (§6.7)

6.3 The Semantic Perspective
To describe relationships among resources, we need to understand what the re­
lations mean. This semantic perspective is the essence of relationships and ex­
plains why the resources are related, relying on information that is not directly
available from perceiving the resources. In our Simpson family example, we no­
ted that Homer and Marge are related by marriage, and also by their relation­
ship as parents of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, and none of these relationships are
directly perceivable. This means that “Homer is married to Marge” is a seman­
tic assertion, but “Homer is standing next to Marge” is not.312[CogSci]
Semantic relationships are commonly expressed with a predicate with one or
more arguments. A predicate is a verb phrase template for specifying properties
of objects or a relationship among objects. In many relationships the predicate
is an action or association that involves multiple participants that must be of

276

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

particular types, and the arguments define the different roles of the partici­
pants.313[CogSci]
We can express the relationship between Homer and Marge Simpson using a
predicate(argument(s)) syntax as follows:
is-married-to (Homer Simpson, Marge Simpson)
The sequence, type, and role of the arguments are an essential part of the rela­
tionship expression. The sequence and role are explicitly distinguished when
predicates that take two arguments are expressed using a subject-predicateobject syntax that is often called a triple because of its three parts:
Homer Simpson → is-married-to → Marge Simpson
However, we have not yet specified what the “is-married-to” relationship means.
People can demonstrate their understanding of “is-married-to” by realizing that
alternative and semantically equivalent expressions of the relationship between
Homer and Marge might be:
Homer Simpson → is-married-to → Marge Simpson
Homer Simpson → is-the-husband-of → Marge Simpson
Marge Simpson → is-married-to → Homer Simpson
Marge Simpson → is-the-wife-of → Homer Simpson
Going one step further, we could say that people understand the equivalence of
these different expressions of the relationship because they have semantic and
linguistic knowledge that relates some representation of “married,” “husband,”
“wife,” and other words. None of that knowledge is visible in the expressions of
the relationships so far, all of which specify concrete relationships about individ­
uals and not abstract relationships between resource classes or concepts. We
have simply pushed the problem of what it means to understand the expressions
into the mind of the person doing the understanding.
We can be more rigorous and define the words used in these expressions so
they are “in the world” rather than just “in the mind” of the person understand­
ing them. We can write definitions about these resource classes:
• The conventional or traditional marriage relationship is a consensual life­
time association between a husband and a wife, which is sanctioned by law
and often by religious ceremonies;
• A husband is a male lifetime partner considered in relation to his wife; and
• A wife is a female lifetime partner considered in relation to her hus­
band.314[Law]

6.3 The Semantic Perspective

277

The Discipline of Organizing

Definitions like these help a person learn and make some sense of the relation­
ship expressions involving Homer and Marge. However, these definitions are
not in a form that would enable someone to completely understand the Homer
and Marge expressions; they rely on other undefined terms (consensual, law,
lifetime, etc.), and they do not state the relationships among the concepts in the
definitions.315[CogSci] Furthermore, for a computer to understand the expressions,
it needs a computer-processable representation of the relationships among
words and meanings that makes every important semantic assumption and
property precise and explicit. We will see what this takes starting in the next
section.

6.3.1 Types of Semantic Relationships
In this discussion we will use entity type, class, concept, and resource type as
synonyms. Entity type and class are conventional terms in data modeling and
database design, concept is the conventional term in computational or cognitive
modeling, and we use resource type when we discuss organizing systems. Simi­
larly, we will use entity occurrence, instance, and resource instance when we re­
fer to one thing rather than to a class or type of them.
There is no real consensus on how to categorize semantic relationships, but
these three broad categories are reasonable for our purposes:
Inclusion Relationship
One entity type contains or is comprised of other entity types; often ex­
pressed using “is-a,” “is-a-type-of,” “is-part-of,” or “is-in” predicates.
Attribution Relationship
Asserting or assigning values to properties; the predicate depends on the
property: “is-the-author-of,” “is-married-to,” “is-employed-by,” etc.
Possession Relationship
Asserting ownership or control of a resource; often expressed using a “has”
predicate, such as “has-serial-number-plate.”316[CogSci]
All of these are fundamental in organizing systems, both for describing and ar­
ranging resources themselves, and for describing the relationships among re­
sources and resource descriptions.

6.3.1.1 Inclusion
There are three different types of inclusion relationships: class inclusion, mero­
nymic inclusion, and topological inclusion. All three are commonly used in or­
ganizing systems.
Class inclusion is the fundamental and familiar “is-a,” “is-a-type-of,” or “sub­
set” relationship between two entity types or classes where one is contained in
and thus more specific than the other more generic one.
Meat → is-a → Food
A set of interconnected class inclusion relationships creates a hierarchy, which
is often called a taxonomy.
Meat → is-a → Food
Dairy Product → is-a → Food
Cereal → is-a → Food
Vegetable → is-a → Food
Beef → is-a → Meat
Pork → is-a → Meat
Chicken → is-a → Meat
Ground Beef → is-a → Beef
Steak → is-a → Beef
...
A visual depiction of the taxonomy makes the class hierarchy easier to perceive.
See Figure 6.1, A Partial Taxonomy of Food.
Each level in a taxonomy subdivides the class above it into sub-classes, and
each sub-class is further subdivided until the differences that remain among the
members of each class no longer matter for the interactions the organizing sys­
tem needs to support. We discuss the design of hierarchical organizing systems
in §7.3, “Principles for Creating Categories.”
All of the examples in the current section have expressed abstract relationships
between classes, in contrast to the earlier concrete ones about Homer and
Marge, which expressed relationships between specific people. Homer and
Marge are instances of classes like “married people,” “husbands,” and “wives.”
When we make an assertion that a particular instance is a member of class, we
are classifying the instance. Classification is a class inclusion relationship be­
tween an instance and a class, rather than between two classes. (We discuss
Classification in detail in Chapter 8.)

Figure 6.1. A Partial Taxonomy of Food.

A partial taxonomy of food distinguishes the categories or prepared food from
meat, distinguishes chicken, beef, and pork as subcategories of meat, and distin­
guishes ground beef and steak as subcategories of beef.

This is just the lowest level of the class hierarchy in which Homer is located at
the very bottom; he is also a man, a human being, and a living organism (in car­
toon land, at least).317[CogSci] You might now remember the bibliographic class in­
clusion hierarchy we discussed in §4.3.2; a specific physical item like your dogeared copy of Macbeth is also a particular manifestation in some format or
genre, and this expression is one of many for the abstract work.
instance→ is-member-of → class

280

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

Part-whole inclusion or meronymic inclusion is a second type of inclusion rela­
tionship. It is usually expressed using “is-part-of,” “is-partly,” or with other simi­
lar predicate expressions. Winston, Chaffin, and Herrmann identified six distinct
types of part-whole relationships. Their meaning subtly differs depending on
whether the part is separately identifiable and whether the part is essential to
the whole.318[CogSci]
• Component-Object is the relationship type when the part is a separate com­
ponent that is arranged or assembled with other components to create a
larger resource. In §4.1.1.1, “Resources with Parts,” we used as an example
the component-object relationship between an engine and a car:
The Engine → is-part-of → the Car
The components of this type of part-whole relationship need not be physical
objects; “Germany is part of the European Union” expresses a componentobject relationship. What matters is that the component is identifiable on its
own as an integral entity and that the components follow some kind of pat­
terned organization or structure when they form the whole. Together the
parts form a composition, and the parts collectively form the whole. A car
that lacks the engine part will not work.
• Member-Collection is the part-whole relationship type where “is-part-of”
means “belongs-to,” a weaker kind of association than component-object be­
cause there is no assumption that the component has a specific role or func­
tion in the whole.
The Book → is-part-of → the Library
The members of the collection exist independently of the whole; if the whole
ceases to exist the individual resources still exist.
• Portion-Mass is the relationship type when all the parts are similar to each
other and to the whole, unlike either of the previous types where engines
are not tires or cars, and books are not like record albums or libraries.
The Slice → is-part-of → the Pie
• Stuff-Object relationships are most often expressed using “is-partly” or “ismade-of” and are distinguishable from component-object ones because the
stuff cannot be separated from the object without altering its identity. The
stuff is not a separate ingredient that is used to make the object; it is a con­
stituent of it once it is made.
Wine → is-partly → Alcohol
• Place-Area relationships exist between areas and specific places or locations
within them. Like members of collections, places have no particular func­
tional contribution to the whole.
The Everglades → are-part-of → Florida
6.3 The Semantic Perspective

281

The Discipline of Organizing

• Feature-Activity is a relationship type in which the components are stages,
phases, or sub activities that take place over time. This relationship is simi­
lar to component-object in that the components in the whole are arranged
according to a structure or pattern.
Overtime → is-part-of → a Football Game
A seventh type of part-whole relationship called Phase-Activity was proposed by
Storey.319[CogSci]
• Phase-Activity is similar to feature-activity except that the phases do not
make sense as standalone activities without the context provided by the ac­
tivity as a whole.
Paying → is-part-of → Shopping
Topological, Locative and Temporal Inclusion is a third type of inclusion rela­
tionship between a container, area, or temporal duration and what it surrounds
or contains. It is most often expressed using “is-in” as the relationship. Howev­
er, the entity that is contained or surrounded is not a part of the including one,
so this is not a part-whole relationship.
The Vatican City → is-in → Italy
The meeting → is-in → the afternoon

6.3.1.2 Attribution
In contrast to inclusion expressions that state relationships between resources,
attribution relationships assert or assign values to properties for a particular re­
source. In Chapter 5 we used “attribute” to mean “an indivisible part of a re­
source description” and treated it as a synonym of “property.” We now need to
be more precise and carefully distinguish between the type of the attribute and
the value that it has. For example, the color of any object is an attribute of the
object, and the value of that attribute might be “green.”
Some frameworks for semantic modeling define “attribute” very narrowly, re­
stricting it to expressions with predicates with only one argument to assert
properties of a single resource, distinguishing them from relationships between
resources or resource types that require two arguments:320[Bus]
Martin the Gecko → is-small
Martin the Gecko → is-green
However, it is always possible to express statements like these in ways that
make them into relationships with two arguments:
Martin → has-size → small
Martin → has-skin-color → green
282

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

Dedre Gentner notes that this supposed distinction between one-predicate at­
tributes and two-predicate relationships depends on context.321[CogSci] For exam­
ple, small can be viewed as an attribute, X → is-small, or as a relationship be­
tween X and some standard or reference Y, X → is-smaller-than → Y.
Another somewhat tricky aspect of attribution relationships is that from a se­
mantic perspective, there are often many different ways of expressing equiva­
lent attribute values.
Martin → has-size → 6 inches
Martin → has size → 152 mm
These two statements express the idea that Martin is small. However, many im­
plementations of attribution relationships treat the attribute values literally.
This means that unless we can process these two statements using another rela­
tionship that expresses the conversion of inches to mm, the two statements
could be interpreted as saying different things about Martin’s size.
Finally, we note that we can express attribution relationships about other rela­
tionships, like the date a relationship was established. Homer and Marge Simp­
son’s wedding anniversary is an attribute of their “is-married-to” relationship.
The semantic distinctions between attributes and other types of relationships
are not strong ones, but they can be made clearer by implementation choices.
For example, XML attributes are tightly coupled to a containing element, and
their literal values are limited to atomic items of information. In contrast, inclu­
sion relationships are expressed by literal containment of one XML element by
another.

6.3.1.3 Possession
A third distinct category of semantic relationships is that of possession. Posses­
sion relationships can seem superficially like part-whole ones:
Bob → has → a car
A car → has → wheels
However, in the second of these relationships “has” is an elliptical form of “has
as a part,” expressing a part-whole relationship rather that one of possession.
The concept of possession is especially important in institutional organizing sys­
tems, where questions of ownership, control, responsibility and transfers of
ownership, control, and responsibility can be fundamental parts of the interac­
tions they support. However, possession is a complex notion, inherently connec­
ted to societal norms and conventions about property and kinship, making it
messier than institutional processes might like.

6.3 The Semantic Perspective

283

The Discipline of Organizing

Possession relationships also imply duration or persistence, and are often diffi­
cult to distinguish from relationships based on habitual location or practice.
Miller and Johnson-Laird illustrate the complex nature of possession relation­
ships with this sentence, which expresses three different types of them:322[Ling]
He owns an umbrella but she’s borrowed it, though she doesn’t have
it with her.

6.3.2 Properties of Semantic Relationships
Semantic relationships can have numerous special properties that help explain
what they mean and especially how they relate to each other. In the following
sections we briefly explain those that are most important in systems for organiz­
ing resources and resource descriptions.

6.3.2.1 Symmetry
In most relationships the order in which the subject and object arguments are
expressed is central to the meaning of the relationship. If X has a relationship
with Y, it is usually not the case that Y has the same relationship with X. For ex­
ample, because “is-parent-of” is an asymmetric relationship, only the first of
these relationships holds:
Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Bart Simpson (TRUE)
Bart Simpson → is-parent-of → Homer Simpson (NOT TRUE)
In contrast, some relationships are symmetric or bi-directional, and reversing
the order of the arguments of the relationship predicate does not change the
meaning. As we noted earlier, these two statements are semantically equivalent
because “is-married-to” is symmetric:
Homer Simpson → is-married-to → Marge Simpson
Marge Simpson → is-married-to → Homer Simpson
We can represent the symmetric and bi-directional nature of these relationships
by using a double-headed arrow:
Homer Simpson ⇔ is-married-to ⇔ Marge Simpson

284

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

6.3.2.2 Transitivity
Transitivity is another property that can apply to semantic relationships. When
a relationship is transitive, if X and Y have a relationship, and Y and Z have the
same relationship, then X also has the relationship with Z. Any relationship
based on ordering is transitive, which includes numerical, alphabetic, and chro­
nological ones as well as those that imply qualitative or quantitative measure­
ment. Because “is-taller-than” is transitive:
Homer Simpson → is-taller-than → Bart Simpson
Bart Simpson → is-taller-than → Maggie Simpson
implies that:
Homer Simpson → is-taller-than → Maggie Simpson
Inclusion relationships are inherently transitive, because just as “is-taller-than”
is an assertion about relative physical size, “is-a-type of” and “is-part-of” are as­
sertions about the relative sizes of abstract classes or categories. An example of
transitivity in part-whole or meronymic relationships is: (1) the carburetor is
part of the engine, (2) the engine is part of the car, (3) therefore, the carburetor
is part of the car. 323[Ling]
Transitive relationships enable inferences about class membership or proper­
ties, and allow organizing systems to be more efficient in how they represent
them since transitivity enables implicit relationships to be made explicit only
when they are needed.

6.3.2.3 Equivalence
Any relationship that is both symmetric and transitive is an equivalence rela­
tionship; “is-equal-to” is obviously an equivalence relationship because if A=B
then B=A and if A=B and B=C, then A=C. Other relationships can be equivalent
without meaning “exactly equal,” as is the relationship of “is-congruent-to” for
all triangles.
We often need to assert that a particular class or property has the same mean­
ing as another class or property or that it is generally substitutable for it. We
make this explicit with an equivalence relationship.
Sister (English) ⇔ is-equivalent-to ⇔ Hermana (Spanish)

6.3 The Semantic Perspective

285

The Discipline of Organizing

6.3.2.4 Inverse
For asymmetric relationships, it is often useful to be explicit about the meaning
of the relationship when the order of the arguments in the relationship is re­
versed. The resulting relationship is called the inverse or the converse of the
first relationship. If an organizing system explicitly represents that:
Is-child-of → is-the-inverse-of → Is-parent-of
We can then conclude that:
Bart Simpson → is-child-of → Homer Simpson

6.3.3 Ontologies
We now have described types and properties of semantic relationships in
enough detail to return to the challenge we posed earlier: what information is
required to fully understand relationships? This question has been asked and
debated for decades and we will not pretend to answer it to any extent here.
However, we can sketch out some of the basic parts of the solution.
Let us begin by recalling that a taxonomy captures a system of class inclusion
relationships in some domain. But as we have seen, there are a great many
kinds of relationships that are not about class inclusion. All of these other types
of relationships represent knowledge about the domain that is potentially nee­
ded to understand statements about it and to make sense when more than one
domain of resources or activities comes together.
For example, in the food domain whose partial taxonomy appears in Figure 6.2,
A Partial Ontology of Food., we can assert relationships about properties of
classes and instances, express equivalences about them, and otherwise enhance
the representation of the food domain to create a complex network of relation­
ships. In addition, the food domain intersects with food preparation, agriculture,
commerce, and many other domains. We also need to express the relationships
among these domains to fully understand any of them.
Grilling → is-a-type-of → Food Preparation
Temperature → is-a-measure-of → Grilling
Hamburger → is-equivalent-to → Ground Beef
Hamburger → is-prepared-by → Grilling
Hamburger Sandwich → is-a-type-of → Prepared Food
Rare → is-a → State of Food Preparation
Well-done → is-a → State of Food Preparation
Meat → is-preserved-by → Freezing
Thawing → is-the-inverse-of → Freezing
...

286

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

Figure 6.2. A Partial Ontology of Food.

A partial ontology of food overlays the taxonomy of food with statements that
make assertions about categories, instances, and relationships in the food do­
main. Example statements might be that “Grilling is a type of food preparation,”
that“Meat is preserved by freezing,” and that “Hamburger is equivalent to
ground beef.”

In this simple example we see that class inclusion relationships form a kind of
backbone to which other kinds of relationships attach. We also see that there
are many potentially relevant assertions that together represent the knowledge
that just about everyone knows about food and related domains. A network of
relationships like these creates a resource that is called an ontology.324[Phil] A vis­
ual depiction of the ontology illustrates this idea that it has a taxonomy as its
conceptual scaffold. (See Figure 6.2, A Partial Ontology of Food.)
6.3 The Semantic Perspective

287

The Discipline of Organizing

There are numerous formats for expressing ontologies, but many of them have
recently converged to or are based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL), de­
veloped by the W3C. OWL ontologies use a formal logic-based language that
builds on RDF (§5.2.2.4 Resource Description Framework (RDF) (page 223)) to
define resource classes and assign properties to them in rigorous ways, arrange
them in a class hierarchy, establish their equivalence, and specify the properties
of relationships.325[Web]
Ontologies are essential parts in some organizing systems, especially
information-intensive ones where the scope and scale of the resources require
an extensive and controlled description vocabulary. (See §5.3 The Process of De­
scribing Resources (page 227).) The most extensive ontology ever created is
Cyc, born in 1984 as an artificial intelligence research project. Three decades
later, the latest version of the Cyc ontology contains several hundred thousand
terms and millions of assertions that interrelate them.326[Com]

6.4 The Lexical Perspective
The semantic perspective for analyzing relationships is the fundamental one,
but it is intrinsically tied to the lexical one because a relationship is always ex­
pressed using words in a specific language. For example, we understand the re­
lationships among the concepts or classes of “food,” “meat,” and “beef” by us­
ing the words “food,” “meat,” and “beef” to identify progressively smaller
classes of edible things in a class hierarchy.
The connection between concept and words is not so simple. In the Simpson
family example with which we began this chapter, we noted with “father” and
“padre” that languages differ in the words they use to describe particular kin­
ship relationships. Furthermore, we pointed out that cultures differ in which
kinship relationships are conceptually distinct, so that languages like Chinese
make distinctions about the relative ages of siblings that are not made in Eng­
lish.327[Ling]
This is not to suggest that an English speaker cannot notice the difference be­
tween his older and younger sisters, only that this distinction is not lexicalized—
captured in a single word—as it is in Chinese. This “missing word” in English
from the perspective of Chinese is called a lexical gap. Exactly when a lexical
gap exists is sometimes tricky, because it depends on how we define “word”—
polar bear and sea horse are not lexicalized but they are a single meaningbearing unit because we do not decompose and reassemble meaning from the
two separate words. These “lexical gaps” differ from language to language,
whereas “conceptual gaps”—the things we cannot think of or directly experi­
ence, like the pull of gravity— may be innate and universal. We revisit this issue
as “linguistic relativity” in Chapter 7. 328[Ling]

288

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

Earlier in this book we discussed the naming of resources (§4.4.2 The Problems
of Naming (page 188)) and the design of a vocabulary for resource description
(§5.3.1.3 Scope, Scale, and Resource Description (page 232)), and we explained
how increasing the scope and scale of an organizing system made it essential to
be more systematic and precise in assigning names and descriptions. We need
to be sure that the terms we use to organize resources capture the similarities
and differences between them well enough to support our interactions with
them. After our discussion about semantic relationships in this chapter, we now
have a clearer sense of what is required to bring like things together, keep dif­
ferent things separate, and to satisfy any other goals for the organizing system.
For example, if we are organizing cars, buses, bicycles, and sleds, all of which
are vehicles, there is an important distinction between vehicles that are motor­
ized and those that are powered by human effort. It might also be useful to dis­
tinguish vehicles with wheels from those that lack them. Not making these dis­
tinctions leaves an unbalanced or uneven organizing system for describing the
semantics of the vehicle domain. However, only the “motorized” concept is lexi­
calized in English, which is why we needed to invent the “wheeled vehicle” term
in the second case.329[Ling]
Simply put, we need to use words effectively in organizing systems. To do that,
we need to be careful about how we talk about the relationships among words
and how words relate to concepts. There are two different contexts for those re­
lationships.
• First, we need to discuss relationships among the meanings of words.
(§6.4.1) and the most commonly used tool for describing them (§6.4.2).
• Second, we need to discuss relationships among the form of words.
(§6.4.3 Relationships among Word Forms (page 293))

6.4.1 Relationships among Word Meanings
There are several different types of relationships of word meanings. Not surpris­
ingly, in most cases they parallel the types of relationships among concepts that
we described in §6.3 The Semantic Perspective (page 276).

6.4.1.1 Hyponymy and Hyperonymy
When words encode the semantic distinctions expressed by class inclusion, the
word for the more specific class in this relationship is called the hyponym, while
the word for the more general class to which it belongs is called the hypernym.
George Miller suggested an exemplary formula for defining a hyponym as its hy­
pernym preceded by adjectives or followed by relative clauses that distinguish it
from its co-hyponyms, mutually exclusive subtypes of the same hypernym.
hyponym = {adjective+} hypernym {distinguishing clause+}
For example, robin is a hyponym of bird, and could be defined as “a migratory
bird that has a clear melodious song and a reddish breast with gray or black up­
per plumage.” This definition does not describe every property of robins, but it
is sufficient to differentiate robins from bluebirds or eagles.330[Ling]

6.4.1.2 Metonymy
Part-whole or meronymic semantic relationships have lexical analogues in met­
onomy, when an entity is described by something that is contained in or other­
wise part of it. A country’s capital city or a building where its top leaders reside
is often used as a metonym for the entire government: “The White House an­
nounced today...” Similarly, important concentrations of business activity are of­
ten metonyms for their entire industries: “Wall Street was bailed out again...”

6.4.1.3 Synonymy
Synonymy is the relationship between words that express the same semantic
concept. The strictest definition is that synonyms “are words that can replace
each other in some class of contexts with insignificant changes of the whole
text’s meaning.”331[Ling] This is an extremely hard test to pass, except for acro­
nyms or compound terms like “USA,” “United States,” and “United States of
America” that are completely substitutable.
Most synonyms are not absolute synonyms, and instead are considered proposi­
tional synonyms. Propositional synonyms are not identical in meaning, but they
are equivalent enough that substituting one for the other will not change the
truth value of the sentence. This weaker test lets us treat word as synonyms
even though their meanings subtly differ. For example, if Lisa Simpson can play
the violin, then because “violin” and “fiddle” are propositional synonyms, no one
would disagree with an assertion that Lisa Simpson can play the fiddle.
An unordered set of synonyms is often called a synset, a term first used by the
WordNet “semantic dictionary” project started in 1985 by George Miller at
Princeton.332[CogSci] Instead of using spelling as the primary organizing principle

for words, WordNet uses their semantic properties and relationships to create a
network that captures the idea that words and concepts are an inseparable sys­
tem. Synsets are interconnected by both semantic relationships and lexical
ones, enabling navigation in either space.333[Bus]

6.4.1.4 Polysemy
We introduced the lexical relationship of polysemy, when a word has several dif­
ferent meanings or senses, in the context of problems with names (§4.4.2.2 Ho­
monymy, Polysemy, and False Cognates (page 189)). For example, the word
“bank” can refer to a: river bank, money bank, bank shots in basketball and bil­
liards, an aircraft maneuver, and other concepts.334[Ling]
Polysemy is represented in WordNet by including a word in multiple synsets.
This enables WordNet to be an extremely useful resource for sense disambigua­
tion in natural language processing research and applications. When a polyse­
mous word is encountered, it and the words that are nearby in the text are
looked up in WordNet. By following the lexical relationships in the synset hierar­
chy, a “synset distance” can be calculated. The smallest semantic distance be­
tween the words, which identifies their most semantically specific hypernym,
can be used to identify the correct sense. For example, in the sentence:

Put the money in the bank
Two of the three WordNet senses for “money” are:
1) the most common medium of exchange
2) the official currency issued by a government or national bank
and the first two of the ten WordNet senses for “bank” are:
1) a financial institution that accepts deposits
2) sloping land, especially the slope beside a body of water
The synset hierarchies for the two senses of “money” intersect after a very short
path with the hierarchy for the first sense of “bank,” but do not intersect with
the second sense of “bank” until they reach very abstract concepts.335[Com]

6.4.1.5 Antonymy
Antonymy is the lexical relationship between two words that have opposite
meanings. Antonymy is a very salient lexical relationship, and for adjectives it is
even more powerful than synonymy. In word association tests, when the probe
word is a familiar adjective, the most common response is its antonym; a probe
of “good” elicits “bad,” and vice versa. Like synonymy, antonymy is sometimes
exact and sometimes more graded.336[Ling]

6.4 The Lexical Perspective

291

The Discipline of Organizing

Contrasting or binary antonyms are used in mutually exclusive contexts where
one or the other word can be used, but never both. For example, “alive” and
“dead” can never be used at the same time to describe the state of some entity,
because the meaning of one excludes or contradicts the meaning of the other.
Other antonymic relationships between word pairs are less semantically sharp
because they can sometimes appear in the same context as a result of the
broader semantic scope of one of the words. “Large” and “small,” or “old” and
“young” generally suggest particular regions on size or age continua, but “how
large is it?” or “how old is it?” can be asked about resources that are objectively
small or young.337[Ling]

6.4.2 Thesauri
The words that people naturally use when they describe resources reflect their
unique experiences and perspectives, and this means that people often use dif­
ferent words for the same resource and the same words for different ones. Guid­
ing people when they select description words from a controlled vocabulary is a
partial solution to this vocabulary problem (§4.4.2.1 The Vocabulary Problem
(page 189)) that becomes increasingly essential as the scope and scale of the or­
ganizing system grows. A thesaurus is a reference work that organizes words
according to their semantic and lexical relationships. Thesauri are often used by
professionals when they describe resources.
Thesauri have been created for many domains and subject areas. Some thesauri
are very broad and contain words from many disciplines, like the Library of
Congress Subject Headings (LOC-SH) used to classify any published content.
Other commonly used thesauri are more focused, like the Art and Architecture
Thesaurus (AAT) developed by the Getty Trust and the Legislative Indexing Vo­
cabulary developed by the Library of Congress.
We can return to our simple food taxonomy to illustrate how a thesaurus anno­
tates vocabulary terms with lexical and semantic relationships. The class inclu­
sion relationships of hypernomy and hyponymy are usually encoded using BT
(“broader term”) and NT (“narrower term”):
Food BT Meat
Beef NT Meat
The BT and NT relationships in a thesaurus create a hierarchical system of
words, but a thesaurus is more than a lexical taxonomy for some domain be­
cause it also encodes additional lexical relationships for the most important
words. Many thesauri emphasize the cluster of relationships for these key
words and de-emphasize the overall lexical hierarchy.

292

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

Because the purpose of a thesaurus is to reduce synonymy, it distinguishes
among synonyms or near-synonyms by indicating one of them as a preferred
term using UF (“used for”):
Food UF Sustenance, Nourishment
A thesaurus might employ USE as the inverse of the UF relationship to refer from
a less preferred or variant term to a preferred one:
Victuals USE Food
Thesauri also use RT (“related term” or “see also”) to indicate terms that are not
synonyms but which often occur in similar contexts:
Food RT Cooking, Dining, Cuisine

6.4.3 Relationships among Word Forms
The relationships among word meanings are critically important. Whenever we
create, combine, or compare resource descriptions we also need to pay atten­
tion to relationships between word forms. These relationships begin with the
idea that all natural languages create words and word forms from smaller units.
The basic building blocks for words are called morphemes and can express se­
mantic concepts (when they are called root words ) or abstract concepts like
“pastness” or “plural”). The analysis of the ways by which languages combine
morphemes is called morphology.339[Ling]
Simple examples illustrate this:

“dogs” = “dog” (root) + “s” (plural)
“uncertain” = “certain” (root) + “un” (negation)
“denied” = “deny” (root) + “ed” (past tense)
Morphological analysis of a language is heavily used in text processing to create
indexes for information retrieval. For example, stemming (discussed in more de­
tail in Chapter 10) is morphological processing which removes prefixes and suf­
fixes to leave the root form of words. Similarly, simple text processing applica­
tions like hyphenation and spelling correction solve word form problems using
roots and rules because it is more scalable and robust than solving them using
word lists. Many misspellings of common words (e.g., “pain”) are words of lower
frequency (e.g., “pane”), so adding “pane” to a list of misspelled words would
occasionally identify it incorrectly. In addition, because natural languages are
generative and create new words all the time, a word list can never be com­
plete; for example, when “flickr” occurs in text, is it a misspelling of “flicker” or
the correct spelling of the popular photo-sharing site?

6.4 The Lexical Perspective

293

The Discipline of Organizing

6.4.3.1 Derivational Morphology
Derivational morphology deals with how words are created by combining mor­
phemes. Compounding, putting two “free morphemes” together as in “batman”
or “catwoman,” is an extremely powerful mechanism. The meaning of some
compounds is easy to understand when the first morpheme qualifies or restricts
the meaning of the second, as in “birdcage” and “tollbooth.” However, many
compounds take on new meanings that are not as literally derived from the
meaning of their constituents, like “seahorse” and “batman.”
Other types of derivations using “bound” morphemes follow more precise rules
for combining them with “base” morphemes. The most common types of bound
morphemes are prefixes and suffixes, which usually create a word of a different
part-of-speech category when they are added. Familiar English prefixes include
“a-,” “ab-,” “anti-,” “co-,” “de-,” “pre-,” and “un-.” Among the most common Eng­
lish suffixes are “-able,” “-ation,” “-ify,” “ing,” “-ity,” “-ize,” “-ment,” and “-ness.”
Compounding and adding prefixes or suffixes are simple mechanisms, but very
complex words like “unimaginability” can be formed by using them in combina­
tion.

6.4.3.2 Inflectional Morphology
Inflectional mechanisms change the form of a word to represent tense, aspect,
agreement, or other grammatical information. Unlike derivation, inflection nev­
er changes the part-of-speech of the base morpheme. The inflectional morpholo­
gy of English is relatively simple compared with other languages.341[Ling]

6.5 The Structural Perspective
The structural perspective analyzes the association, arrangement, proximity, or
connection between resources without primary concern for their meaning or the
origin of these relationships.342[Com] We take a structural perspective when we
define a family as “a collection of people” or when we say that a particular fami­
ly like the Simpsons has five members. Sometimes all we know is that two re­
sources are connected, as when we see a highlighted word or phrase that is
pointing from the current web page to another. At other times we might know
more about the reasons for the relationships within a set of resources, but we
still focus on their structure, essentially merging or blurring all of the reasons
for the associations into a single generic notion that the resources are connec­
ted.

Travers and Milgram conducted a now-famous study in the 1960s involving the
delivery of written messages between people in the midwestern and eastern
United States. If a person did not know the intended recipient, he was instruc­
ted to send the message to someone that he thought might know him. The study
demonstrated what Travers and Milgram called the “small world problem,” in
which any two arbitrarily selected people were separated by an average of few­
er than six links.
It is now common to analyze the number of “degrees of separation” between
any pair of resources. For example, Markoff and Sengupta describe a 2011
study using Facebook data that computed the average “degree of separation” of
any two people in the Facebook world to be 4.74.343[Com]
Many types of resources have internal
structure in addition to their structur­
al relationships with other resources.
Of course, we have to remember (as
we discussed in §4.3 Resource Identity
(page 182)) that we often face arbi­
trary choices about the abstraction
and granularity with which we de­
scribe the parts that make up a re­
source and whether some combina­
tion of resource should also be identi­
fied as a resource. This is not easy
when you are analyzing the structure
of a car with its thousands of parts,
and it is ever harder with information
resources where there are many more
ways to define parts and wholes.
However, an advantage for informa­
tion resources is that their internal
structural descriptions are usually
highly “computable,” something we
consider in depth in Chapter 10, Inter­
actions with Resources.

Stop and Think: Kevin Bacon
Numbers
See http://oracleofbacon.org/ for a
web-based demonstration of “Kevin
Bacon Numbers,” which measure
the average degrees of separation
among more than 2.6 million actors
in more than 1.9 million movies. Its
name reflects the parlor game “Six
Degrees of Kevin Bacon,” a pun on
“six degrees of separation” that is
often associated with Travers and
Milgram's work; the game relies on
the remarkable variety of Bacon's
roles, and hence the number of fel­
low actors in his movies (two actors
in the same movie have one degree
of separation). Bacon's Bacon Num­
ber is 2.994, but it turns out that
more than 300 actors are closer to
the center of the movie universe
than Bacon. Try some famous ac­
tors and see if their Bacon Numbers
are greater or smaller than Bacon's.
(Hint: older actors have been in
more movies.)

The Discipline of Organizing

Business Structures
Management science is constantly reevaluating different structures for or­
ganizations. Many large businesses are organized similarly near the top,
with a board of directors, a chief executive officer, and other executives who
manage the vice presidents or directors of various business units. Within
and across these business units, however, there are significant variations in
how a business can organize its people.
Management strategies are built around the style of organization the busi­
ness has chosen. These organizational choices reflect the CEO’s manage­
ment philosophy, the industry, regulatory requirements, operating scale,
and other factors. Strict hierarchies are a traditional approach, with a tree
structure leading from the lowest level worker directly up to the CEO. The
strict management hierarchy at Foxconn is needed to enable close oversight
of large numbers of low level employees in the manufacturing industry, with
workers organized by physical location.
Other firms have a matrix structure in which an employee can be working
on multiple projects, and reporting to a different manager for each one. A
consulting firm’s matrix structure might emphasize an employee’s function­
al role (e.g., “process engineering consultant”) and disassociate it from the
employee’s home location, which is why consultants spend so much time
traveling on airplanes from project to project.

6.5.1 Intentional, Implicit, and Explicit Structure
In the discipline of organizing we emphasize “intentional structure” created by
people or by computational processes rather than accidental or naturallyoccurring structures created by physical and geological processes. We acknowl­
edged in §1.5 that there is information in the piles of debris left after a tornado
or tsunami and in the strata of the Grand Canyon. These structural patterns
might be of interest to meteorologists, geologists, or others but because they
were not created by an identifiable agent following one or more organizing prin­
ciples, they are not our primary focus.
Some organizing principles impose very little structure. For a small collection of
resources, co-locating them or arranging them near each other might be suffi­
cient organization. We can impose two- or three-dimensional coordinate systems
on this “implicit structure” and explicitly describe the location of a resource as
precisely as we want, but we more naturally describe the structure of resource
locations in relative terms. In English we have many ways to describe the struc­
tural relationship of one resource to another: “in,” “on,” “under,” “behind,”
“above,” “below,” “near,” “to the right of,” “to the left of,” “next to,” and so on.
Sometimes several resources are arranged or appear to be arranged in a
296

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

sequence or order and we can use po­
sitional descriptions of structure: a
late 1990s TV show described the
planet Earth as the “third rock from
the Sun.”344[CogSci]
We pay most attention to intentional
structures that are explicitly repre­
sented within and between resources
because they embody the design or
authoring choices about how much
implicit or latent structure will be
made explicit. Structures that can be
reliably extracted by algorithms be­
come especially important for very
large collections of resources whose
scope and scale defy structural analy­
sis by people.

6.5.2 Structural Relationships
within a Resource

Stop and Think: Intentional,
implicit/explicit structure
Find a map of the states (or provin­
ces or other divisions) in your coun­
try. You probably think of some set
of these as members of a collection.
Other than their literal arrange­
ment (e.g., “x is next to y, y is east
of z”), how could you describe their
relationships to each other within
the collection? Are these relation­
ships based on natural or uninten­
tional properties or intentional
ones? Example: in the United
States, California, Oregon, and
Washington are considered the
“West Coast” and the Pacific Ocean
determines their western bounda­
ries. Some of the borders between
the states are natural, determined
by rivers, and other borders are
more intentional and arbitrary.

We almost always think of human and
other animate resources as unitary
entities. Likewise, many physical re­
sources like paintings, sculptures, and manufactured goods have a material in­
tegrity that makes us usually consider them as indivisible. For an information
resource, however, it is almost always the case that it has or might have had
some internal structure or sub-division of its constituent data elements.
In fact, since all computer files are merely encodings of bits, bytes, characters
and strings, all digital resources exhibit some internal structure, even if that
structure is only discernible by software agents. Fortunately, the once inscruta­
ble internal formats of word processing files are now much more interpretable
after they were replaced by XML in the last decade.
When an author writes a document, he or she gives it some internal organiza­
tion with its title, section headings, typographic conventions, page numbers,
and other mechanisms that identify its parts and their significance or relation­
ship to each other. The lowest level of this structural hierarchy, usually the para­
graph, contains the text content of the document. Sometimes the author finds it
useful to identify types of content like glossary terms or cross-references within
the paragraph text. Document models that mix structural description with con­
tent “nuggets” in the text are said to contain mixed content.

6.5 The Structural Perspective

297

The Discipline of Organizing

Mixed Content
Mixed content distinguishes XML
from other data representation lan­
guages. It is this structural feature,
combined with the fact that child
nodes in the XML Infoset (§9.2.2.2)
are ordered, that makes it possible
for XML documents to function both
as human reader-oriented, textual
documents and as structured data
formats. It allows us to use natural
language in writing descriptions
while still enabling us to identify
content by type by embedding
markup to enclose “semantic nug­
gets” in otherwise undifferentiated
text.345[Com]
The Guidelines for Electronic Text
Encoding and Interchange, pro­
duced by the Text Encoding Initia­
tive (TEI), for example, includes a
set of elements and attributes for
Names, Dates, People and Pla­
ces.346[Com]

In data-intensive or transactional do­
mains, document instances tend to be
homogeneous because they are pro­
duced by or for automated processes,
and their information components will
appear predictably in the same struc­
tural relationships with each other.
These structures typically form a hier­
archy expressed in an XML schema or
word processing style template. XML
documents describe their component
parts using content-oriented elements
like <ITEM>, <NAME>, and <ADDRESS>, that
are themselves often aggregate struc­
tures or containers for more granular
elements. The structures of resources
maintained in databases are typically
less hierarchical, but the structures
are precisely captured in database
schemas.

The internal parts of XML documents
can be described, found and selected
using the XPath language, which de­
fines the structures and patterns used
by XML forms, queries, and transfor­
mations. The key idea used by XPath
is that the structure of XML documents is a tree of information items called no­
des, whose locations are described in terms of the relationships between nodes.
The relationships built into XPath, which it calls axes, include self, child, parent,
following, and preceding, making it very easy to specify a structure-based query
like “find all sections in Chapter 1 through Chapter 5 that have at least two lev­
els of subsections.”347[Com] In addition, tools like Schematron take advantage of
XPath’s structural descriptions to test assertions about a document’s structure
and content. For example, a common editorial constraint might be that a num­
bered list must have at least three items.348[Com]
In more qualitative, less information-intensive and more experience-intensive
domains, we move toward the narrative end of the Document Type Spectrum,
and document instances become more heterogeneous because they are pro­
duced by and for people. (See the sidebar, The Document Type Spectrum (page
168) in §4.2.1.) The information conveyed in the documents is conceptual or the­
matic rather than transactional, and the structural relationships between docu­
ment parts are much weaker. Instead of precise structure and content rules,

298

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

there is usually just a shallow hierarchy marked up with Word processing or
HTML tags like <HEAD>, <H1>, <H2>, and <LIST>.

Structural Metadata
Structural metadata, in the form of a schema for a database or document,
describes a class of information resources, and may also prescribe gram­
matical details of inclusion and attribution relationships among the compo­
nents. For example, the chapters of this book contain four levels of subsec­
tions. Each of those sections contains a title, some paragraphs and other
text blocks, and subordinate sections. The textual content of the paragraphs
includes highlighted terms and phrases that are defined in situ and refer­
enced again in the glossary and index; there are also bibliographic citations
that are reflected in the bibliography and index. We can discover these char­
acteristics of a book through observation, but we could also examine its
structural metadata, in its schema.
Structural metadata allows us to describe and prescribe relations among
database tables, within the chapters of a book, or among parts in an inven­
tory management system. The schema for HTML, for example, informs us
that the <A> element can be used to signal a hypertext link-end; whether
that link-end is an anchor or a target, or both, depends on the combination
of values assigned to attributes. In HTML, the optional REL attribute may
contain a value that signals the purpose of a hypertext link, and any HTML
element may include a CLASS attribute value that may be used as a CSS se­
lector for the purposes of formatting or dynamic interactions.
The usefulness of any given schema is often a function of the precision with
which we may make useful statements based upon the descriptions and pre­
scriptions it offers. Institutional schemas tend to be more prescriptive and
restrictive, stressing professional orthodoxy and conformance to controlled
vocabularies. Schemas for the information content in social and informal ap­
plications tend to be less prescriptive. Whether and how we use structural
metadata is a tradeoff. Structural metadata is essential to enable quality
control and maintenance in information collection and publishing processes,
but someone has to do the work to create it.
The internal structural hierarchy in a resource is often extracted and made into
a separate and familiar description resource called the “table of contents” to
support finding and navigation interactions with the primary resource. In a prin­
ted media context, any given content resource is likely to only be presented
once, and its page number is provided in the table of contents to allow the read­
er to locate the chapter, section or appendix in question. In a hypertext media
context, a given resource may be a chapter in one book while being an appendix
in another. Some tables of contents are created as a static structural de­

DocBook Schema
The schema most commonly used for
producing technical books is called Doc­
Book; it describes every XML element
and attribute and prescribes their
grammatical forms. The schema lets us
know that a formal paragraph must in­
clude a title, and that a title may con­
tain emphasis. A schema can also de­
scribe and prescribe the lexical value
space of a postal code, or require that
every list must have at least three
items. The DocBook schema is welldocumented and has been productiontested in institutional publishing con­
texts for over twenty years.349[Com]

Many indexing algorithms treat
documents as “bags of words” to
compute statistics about the fre­
quency and distribution of the words they contain while ignoring all semantics
and structure. In Chapter 10, Interactions with Resources, we contrast this ap­
proach with algorithms that use internal structural descriptions to retrieve
more specific parts of documents.

6.5.3 Structural Relationships between Resources
Many types of resources have “structural relationships” that interconnect them.
Web pages are almost always linked to other pages. Sometimes the links among
a set of pages remain mostly within those pages, as they are in an e-commerce

catalog site. More often, however, links connect to pages in other sites, creating
a link network that cuts across and obscures the boundaries between sites.
The links between documents can be analyzed to infer connections between the
authors of the documents. Using the pattern of links between documents to un­
derstand the structure of knowledge and of the intellectual community that cre­
ates it is not a new idea, but it has been energized as more of the information
we exchange with other people is on the web or otherwise in digital formats. An
important function in Google’s search engine is the page rank algorithm that
calculates the relevance of a page in part using the number of links that point to
it while giving greater weight to pages that are themselves linked to of­
ten.351[Web]
Web-based social networks enable people to express their connections with oth­
er people directly, bypassing the need to infer the connections from links in
documents or other communications.

6.5.3.1 Hypertext Links
The concept of read-only or follow-only structures that connect one document to
another is usually attributed to Vannevar Bush in his seminal 1945 essay titled
“As We May Think.” Bush called it associative indexing, defined as “a provision
whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically
another.”352[Com] The “item” connected in this way was for Bush most often a
book or a scientific article. However, the anchor and destination of a hypertext
link can be a resource of any granularity, ranging from a single point or charac­
ter, a paragraph, a document, or any part of the resource to which the ends of
link are connected. The anchor and destination of a web link are its structural
specification, but we often need to consider links from other perspectives. (See
the sidebar, Perspectives on Hypertext Links (page 303)).
Theodor Holm Nelson, in a book intriguingly titled Literary Machines, renamed
associative indexing as hypertext decades later, expanding the idea to make it a
writing style as well as a reading style.353[Com] Nelson urged writers to use hy­
pertext to create non-sequential narratives that gave choices to readers, using a
novel technique for which he coined the term transclusion.354[Com]
At about the same time, and without knowing about Nelson’s work, Douglas En­
gelbart’s Augmenting the Human Intellect, described a future world in which
professionals equipped with interactive computer displays utilize an information
space consisting of a cross-linked resources.355[Com]
In the 1960s, when computers lacked graphic displays and were primarily em­
ployed to solve complex mathematical and scientific problems that might take
minutes, hours or even days to complete, Nelson’s and Engelbart’s visions of
hypertext-based personal computing may have seemed far-fetched. In spite of

Transclusion
The inclusion, by hypertext refer­
ence, of a resource or part of a re­
source into another resource is
called transclusion. Transclusion is
normally performed automatically,
without user intervention. The in­
clusion of images in web documents
is an example of transclusion.
Transclusion is a frequently used
technique in business and legal
document processing, where re-use
of consistent and up-to-date content
is essential to achieve efficiency
and consistency.

this, by 1968, Engelbart and his team
demonstrated human computer inter­
face including the mouse, hypertext,
and interactive media, along with a
set of guiding principles.356[Com]

Hypertext links are now familiar
structural mechanisms in information
applications because of the World
Wide Web, proposed in 1989 by Tim
Berners-Lee
and
Robert
Cail­
liau.357[Web] They invented the methods
for encoding and following hypertext
links using the now popular Hyper­
Text Markup Language (HTML).358[Web]
The resources connected by HTML’s
hypertext links are not limited to text
or documents. Selecting a hypertext
link can invoke a connected resource that might be a picture, video, or interac­
tive application.359[Com]
By 1993, personal computers, with a graphic display, speakers and a mouse
pointer, had become ubiquitous. NCSA Mosaic is widely credited with populariz­
ing the World Wide Web and HTML in 1993, by introducing inline graphics, au­
dio and video media, rather than having to link to media segments in a separate
window.360[Web] The ability to transclude images and other media would trans­
form the World Wide Web from a text-only viewer with links to a “networked
landscape” with hypertext signposts to guide the way. On 12 November 1993,
the first full release of NCSA Mosaic on the world’s three most popular operat­
ing systems (X Windows, Microsoft Windows, and Apple Macintosh) enabled the
general public to access the network with a graphical browser.361[Web]
Since browsers made them familiar, hypertext links have been used in other
computing applications as structure and navigation mechanisms.

Perspectives on Hypertext Links
A lexical perspective on hypertext links concerns the words that are used to
signal the presence of a link or to encode its type. In web contexts, the
words in which a structural link is embedded are called the anchor text.
More generally, rhetorical structure theory analyzes how different conven­
tions or signals in texts indicate relationships between texts or parts of
them, like the subtle differences in polarity among “see,” “see also,” and
“but see” as citation signals.362[Ling]
Many hypertext links in web pages are purely structural because they lack
explicit representation of the reason for the relationship. When it is evident,
this semantic property of the link is called the link type.363[Com]
An architectural perspective on links considers whether links are one-way
or bi-directional. When a bi-directional link is created between an anchor
and a destination, it is as though a one-way link that can be followed in the
opposite direction is automatically created. Two one-way links serve the
same purpose, but the return link is not automatically established when the
first one is created. A second architectural consideration is whether to em­
ploy binary links, connecting one anchor to one destination, or n-ary links,
connecting one anchor to multiple types of destinations.364[Com] (See §6.6)
A “front end” or “surface” implementation perspective on hypertext links
concerns how the presence of the link is indicated in a user interface; this is
called the “link marker”; underlining or coloring of clickable text are con­
ventional markers for web links.365[Web] 366[IA] A “back end” implementation is­
sue is whether links are contained or embedded in the resources they link
or whether they are stored separately in a link base.367[Web] (See §6.7)

6.5.3.2 Analyzing Link Structures
We can portray a set of links between resources graphically as a pattern of box­
es and links. Because a link connection from one resource to another need not
imply a link in the opposite direction, we distinguish one-way links from explicit­
ly bi-directional ones.
A graphical representation of link structure is shown on the left panel of figure
Figure 6.3, Representing Link Structures.. For a small network of links, a diagram
like this one makes it easy to see that some resources have more incoming or
outgoing links than other resources. However, for most purposes we leave the
analysis of link structures to computer programs, and there it is much better to
represent the link structures more abstractly in matrix form. In this matrix the
resource identifiers on the row and column heads represent the source and des­
tination of the link. This is a full matrix because not all of the links are symmet­
ric; a link from resource 1 to resource 2 does not imply one from 2 to 1.

Figure 6.3. Representing Link Structures.

The structure of links between web resources can be represented graphically or
in a matrix. The matrix representation is a more abstract one that can be ana­
lyzed by computers.

A matrix representation of the same link structure is shown on the right panel
of Figure 6.3, Representing Link Structures.. This representation models the net­
work as a directed graph in which the resources are the vertices and the rela­
tionships are the edges that connect them. We now can apply graph algorithms
to determine many useful properties. A very important property is reachability,
the “can you get there from here” property.368[Com] Other useful properties in­
clude the average number of incoming or outgoing links, the average distance
between any two resources, and the shortest path between them.

6.5.3.3 Bibliometrics, Shepardizing, Altmetrics, and Social Network
Analysis
Information scientists began studying the structure of scientific citation, now
called bibliometrics, nearly a century ago to identify influential scientists and
publications. This analysis of the flow of ideas through publications can identify
“invisible colleges” of scientists who rely on each other’s research, and recog­
nize the emergence of new scientific disciplines or research areas. Universities
use bibliometrics to evaluate professors for promotion and tenure, and libraries
use it to select resources for their collections.

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

The expression of citation relationships between documents is especially
nuanced in legal contexts, where the use of legal cases as precedents makes it
essential to distinguish precisely where a new ruling lies on the relational con­
tinuum between “Following” and “Overruling” with respect to a case it cites.
The analysis of legal citations to determine whether a cited case is still good law
is called Shepardizing because lists of cases annotated in this way were first
published in the late 1800s by Frank Shepard, a salesman for a legal publishing
company.370[Law]
The links pointing to a web page might be thought of as citations to it, so it is
tempting to make the analogy to consider Shepardizing the web. But unlike le­
gal rulings, web pages aren’t always persistent, and only courts have the au­
thority to determine the value of cited cases as precedents, so Shepard-like met­
rics for web pages would be tricky to calculate and unreliable.
Nevertheless, the web’s importance as a publishing and communication medium
is undeniable, and many scholars, especially younger ones, now contribute to
their fields by blogging, Tweeting, leaving comments on online publications,
writing Wikipedia articles, giving MOOC lectures, and uploading papers, code,
and datasets to open access repositories. Because the traditional bibliometrics
pay no attention to this body of work, alternative metrics or “altmetrics” have
been proposed to count these new venues for scholarly influence.
Facebook’s valuation is based on its ability to exploit the structure of a person’s
social network to personalize advertisements for people and “friends” to whom
they are connected. Many computer science researchers are working to deter­
mine the important characteristics of people and relationships that best identify
the people whose activities or messages influence others to spend money.372[Com]

6.6 The Architectural Perspective
The architectural perspective emphasizes the number and abstraction level of
the components of a relationship, which together characterize the complexity of
the relationship. We will briefly consider three architectural issues: degree (or
arity), cardinality, and directionality.
These architectural concepts come from data modeling and they enable rela­
tionships to be described precisely and abstractly, which is essential for main­
taining an organizing system that implements relationships among resources.
Application and technology lifecycles have never been shorter, and vast
amounts of new data are being created by increased tracking of online interac­
tions and by all the active resources that are now part of the Internet of Things.
Organizing systems built without clear architectural foundations cannot easily
scale up in size and scope to handle these new requirements.

6.6 The Architectural Perspective

305

The Discipline of Organizing

6.6.1 Degree
The degree or arity of a relationship is the number of entity types or categories
of resources in the relationship. This is usually, though not always, the same as
the number of arguments in the relationship expression.
Homer Simpson (husband) ⇔ is-married-to ⇔ Marge Simpson (wife)
is a relationship of degree 2, a binary relationship between two entity types, be­
cause the “is-married-to” relationship as we first defined it requires one of the
arguments to be of entity type “husband” and one of them to be of type “wife.”
Now suppose we change the definition of marriage to allow the two participants
in a marriage to be any instance of the entity type “person.” The relationship ex­
pression looks exactly the same, but its degree is now unary because only 1 en­
tity type is needed to instantiate the two arguments:
Homer Simpson (person) ⇔ is-married-to ⇔ Marge Simpson (person)
Some relationships are best expressed as ternary ones that involve three differ­
ent entity types. An example that appears in numerous data modeling books is
one like this:
Supplier → provides → Part → assembled-in → Product
It is always possible to represent ternary relationships as a set of binary ones by
creating a new entity type that relates to each of the others in turn. This new
entity type is called a dummy in modeling practice.
Supplier → provides → DUMMY
Part → provided-for → DUMMY
DUMMY → assembled-in → Product
This transformation from a sensible ternary relationship to three binary ones in­
volving a DUMMY entity type undoubtedly seems strange, but it enables all re­
lationships to be binary while still preserving the meaning of the original terna­
ry one. Making all relationships binary makes it easier to store relationships and
combine them to discover new ones.

306

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

6.6.2 Cardinality
The cardinality of a relationship is the number of instances that can be associ­
ated with each entity type in a relationship. At first glance this might seem to be
degree by another name, but it is not.
Cardinality is easiest to explain for binary relationships. If we return to Homer
and Marge, the binary relationship that expresses that they are married hus­
band and wife is a one-to-one relationship because a husband can only have one
wife and a wife can only have one husband (at a time, in monogamous societies
like the one in which the Simpsons live).
In contrast, the “is-parent-of” relationship is one-to-many, because the meaning
of being a parent makes it correct to say that:
Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Bart AND Lisa AND Maggie
As we did with the ternary relationship in §6.6.1 Degree (page 306), we can
transform this more complex relationship architecture to a set of simpler ones
by restricting expressions about being a parent to the one-to-one cardinality.
Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Bart
Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Lisa
Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Maggie
The one-to-many expression brings all three of Homer’s children together as ar­
guments in the same relational expression, making it more obvious that they
share the same relationship than in the set of separate and redundant one-toone expressions.

6.6.3 Directionality
The directionality of a relationship defines the order in which the arguments of
the relationship are connected. A one-way or uni-directional relationship can be
followed in only one direction, whereas a bi-directional one can be followed in
both directions.
All symmetric relationships are bi-directional, but not all bi-directional relation­
ships are symmetric. (See §6.3.2.1 Symmetry (page 284).) A relationship be­
tween a manager and an employee that he manages is “employs,” a different
meaning than the “is-employed-by” relationship in the opposite direction. As in
this example, the relationship is often lexicalized in only one direction.

6.6 The Architectural Perspective

307

The Discipline of Organizing

6.7 The Implementation Perspective
Finally, the implementation perspective on relationships considers how a rela­
tionship is realized or encoded in a technology context. The implementation per­
spective contrasts strongly with the conceptual, structural, and architectural
perspectives, which emphasize the meaning and abstract structure of relation­
ships. The implementation perspective is a superset of the lexical perspective,
because the choice of the language in which to express a relationship is an im­
plementation decision. However, most people think of implementation as all of
the decisions about technological form rather than just about the choice of
words.
In this book we focus on the fundamental issues and challenges that apply to all
organizing systems, and not just on information-intensive ones that rely exten­
sively on technology. Even with this reduced scope, there are some critical im­
plementation concerns about the notation, syntax, and deployment of the rela­
tionships and other descriptions about resources. We briefly introduce some of
these issues here and then discuss them in detail in Chapter 9, The Forms of Re­
source Descriptions.

6.7.1 Choice of Implementation
The choice of implementation determines how easy it is to understand and proc­
ess a set of relationships. For example, the second sentence of this chapter is a
natural language implementation of a set of relationships in the Simpson family:
The Simpson family includes a man named Homer and a woman
named Marge, the married parents of three sibling children, a boy
named Bart and two girls, Lisa and Maggie.
A subject-predicate-object syntax makes the relationships more explicit:

Example 6.1. Subject-predicate syntax
Homer Simpson → is-married-to → Marge Simpson
Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Bart
Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Lisa
Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Maggie
Marge Simpson → is-married-to → Homer Simpson
Marge Simpson → is-parent-of → Bart
Marge Simpson → is-parent-of → Lisa
Marge Simpson → is-parent-of → Maggie
Bart Simpson → is-a → Boy
Lisa Simpson → is-a → Girl
Maggie Simpson → is-a → Girl
308

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

In the following example of a potential XML implementation syntax, we empha­
size class inclusion relationships by using elements as containers, and the rela­
tionships among the members of the family are expressed explicitly through ref­
erences, using XML’s ID and IDREF attribute types:373[Com]

Example 6.2. An XML implementation syntax
<Family name="Simpson">
<Parents children="Bart Lisa Maggie">
<Father name="Homer" spouse="Marge" />
<Mother name="Marge" spouse="Homer" />
</Parents>
<Children parents="Homer Marge" >
<Boy name="Bart" siblings="Lisa Maggie" />
<Girl name="Lisa" siblings="Bart Maggie" />
<Girl name="Maggie" siblings="Bart Lisa" />
</Children>
</Family>
None of the models we have presented so far in this chapter represents the
complexities of modern families that involve multiple marriages and children
from more than one marriage, but they are sufficient for our limited demonstra­
tion purposes.

6.7.2 Syntax and Grammar
The syntax and grammar of a language consists of the rules that determine
which combinations of its words are allowed and are thus grammatical or wellformed. Natural languages have substantial similarities by having nouns, verbs,
adjectives and other parts of speech, but they differ greatly in how they arrange
them to create sentences. Conformance to the rules for arranging these parts
makes a sentence syntactically compliant but does not mean that an expression
is semantically comprehensible; the classic example is Chomsky’s anomalous
sentence:
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously
Any meaning this sentence has is odd, difficult to visualize, and outside of readi­
ly accessible experience, but anyone who knows the English language can rec­
ognize that it follows its syntactic rules, as opposed to this sentence, which
breaks them and seems completely meaningless:
Ideas colorless sleep furiously green374[Ling]

6.7 The Implementation Perspective

309

The Discipline of Organizing

6.7.3 Requirements for Implementation Syntax
The most basic requirement for implementation syntax is that it can represent
all the expressions that it needs to express. For the examples in this chapter we
have used an informal combination of English words and symbols (arrows and
parentheses) that you could understand easily, but simple language is incapable
of expressing most of what we readily say in English. But this benefit of natural
language only accrues to people, and the more restrictive and formal syntax is
easier to understand for computers.
A second consideration is that the implementation can be understood and used
by its intended users. We can usually express a relationship in different lan­
guages while preserving its meaning, just as we can usually implement the
same computing functionality in different programming languages. From a se­
mantic perspective these three expressions are equivalent:
My name is Homer Simpson
Mon nom est Homer Simpson
Mein name ist Homer Simpson
However, whether these expressions are equivalent for someone reading them
depends on which languages they understand.
An analogous situation occurs with the implementation of web pages. HTML
was invented as a language for encoding how web pages look in a browser, and
most of the tags in HTML represent the simple structure of an analogous print
document. Representing paragraphs, list items and numbered headings with <P>
and <LI> and <Hn> makes using HTML so easy that school children can create
web pages. However, the “web for eyes” implemented using HTML is of less ef­
ficient or practical for computers that want to treat content as product catalogs,
orders, invoices, payments, and other business transactions and information
that can be analyzed and processed. This “web for computers” is best imple­
mented using domain-specific vocabularies in XML.

6.8 Relationships in Organizing Systems
In the previous sections as we surveyed the five perspectives on analyzing rela­
tionships we mentioned numerous examples where relationships had important
roles in organizing systems. In this final section we examine three contexts for
organizing systems where relationships are especially fundamental; the Seman­
tic Web and Linked Data, bibliographic organizing systems, and situations in­
volving system integration and interoperability.

310

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

6.8.1 The Semantic Web and Linked Data
In a classic 2001 paper, Tim Berners-Lee laid out a vision of a Semantic Web in
which all information could be shared and processed by automated tools as well
as by people.375[Web] The essential technologies for making the web more seman­
tic and relationships among web resources more explicit are applications of
XML, including RDF (§5.2.2.4 Resource Description Framework (RDF) (page
223)), and OWL (§6.3.3 Ontologies (page 286)). Many tools have been developed
to support more semantic encoding, but most still require substantial expertise
in semantic technologies and web standards.376[Com]
More likely to succeed are applications that aim lower, not trying to encode all
the latent semantics in a document or web page. For example, some wiki and
blogging tools contain templates for semantic annotation, and Wikipedia has
thousands of templates and “info boxes” to encourage the creation of informa­
tion in content-encoded formats.

Wikipedia Info Boxes

The “Linked Data” movement is an
extension of the Semantic Web idea to
reframe the basic principles of the
web’s architecture in more semantic
terms. Instead of the limited role of
links as simple untyped relationships
between HTML documents, links be­
tween resources described by RDF
can serve as the bridges between is­
lands of semantic data, creating a
Linked Data network or cloud.377[Web]

6.8.2 Bibliographic Organizing
Systems
Wikipedia encourages authors to aug­
ment their articles with “info boxes”
that organize sets of structured infor­
mation generically relevant to the
type of resource that is the subject of
the article. These three examples
show parts of the info boxes for
“Company,” “Song,” and “City.”
(Collage of screenshots by R. Glush­
ko.)

Much of our thinking about relation­
ships in organizing systems for infor­
mation comes from the domain of bib­
liographic cataloging of library re­
sources and the related areas of clas­
sification systems and descriptive the­
sauri. Bibliographic relationships pro­
vide an important means to build
structure into library catalogs.

Bibliographic relationships are com­
mon among library resources. Smira­
glia and Leazer found that approximately 30% of the works in the Online Com­
6.8 Relationships in Organizing Systems

311

The Discipline of Organizing

puter Library Center (OCLC) WorldCat union catalog have associated derivative
works. Relationships among items within these bibliographic families differ, but
the average family size for those works with derivative works was found to be
3.54 items. Moreover, “canonical” works that have strong cultural meaning and
influence, such as “the plays of William Shakespeare” and The Bible, have very
large and complex bibliographic families.

6.8.2.1 Tillett’s Taxonomy
Barbara Tillett, in a study of 19th and 20th-century catalog rules, found that
many different catalog rules have existed over time to describe bibliographic re­
lationships. She developed a taxonomy of bibliographic relationships that in­
cludes equivalence, derivative, descriptive, whole-part, accompanying, sequen­
tial or chronological, and shared characteristic. These relationship types span
the relationship perspectives defined in this chapter; equivalence, derivative,
and description are semantic types; whole-part and accompanying are part se­
mantic and part structural types; sequential or chronological are part lexical
and part structural types; and shared characteristics are part semantic and part
lexical types.

6.8.2.2 Resource Description and Access (RDA)
Many cataloging researchers have recognized that online catalogs do not do a
very good job of encoding bibliographic relationships among items, both due to
catalog display design and to the limitations of how information is organized
within catalog records. Author name authority databases, for example, provide
information for variant author names, which can be very important in finding all
of the works by a single author, but this information is not held within a catalog
record. Similarly, MARC records can be formatted and displayed in web library
catalogs, but the data within the records are not available for re-use, repurposing, or re-arranging by researchers, patrons, or librarians.
The Resource Description and Access (RDA) next-generation cataloging rules
are attempting to bring together disconnected resource descriptions to provide
more complete and interconnected data about works, authors, publications,
publishers, and subjects.
RDA uses RDF to assert relationships among bibliographic materials.

6.8.2.3 RDA and the Semantic Web
The move in RDA to encode bibliographic data in RDF stems from the desire to
make library catalog data more web-accessible. As web-based data mash-ups,
application programming interfaces (APIs), and web searching are becoming
ubiquitous and expected, library data are becoming increasingly isolated. The

312

Chapter 6 — Describing Relationships and Structures

Informatics Edition

developers of RDA see RDF as the means for making library data more widely
available online.
In addition to simply making library data more web accessible, RDA seeks to
leverage the distributed nature of the Semantic Web. Once rules for describing
resources, and the relationships between them, are declared in RDF syntax and
made publicly available, the rules themselves can be mixed and mashed up. Cre­
ators of information systems that use RDF can choose elements from any RDF
schema. For example, we can use the Dublin Core metadata schema (which has
been aligned with the RDF model) and the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) schema (a
schema to describe people and the relationships between them) to create a set
of metadata elements about a journal article that goes beyond the standard bib­
liographic information. RDA’s process of moving to RDF is well underway.

6.8.3 Integration and Interoperability
Integration is the controlled sharing of information between two (or more) busi­
ness systems, applications, or services within or between firms. Integration
means that one party can extract or obtain information from another one, it
does not imply that the recipient can make use of the information.
Interoperability goes beyond integration to mean that systems, applications, or
services that exchange information can make sense of what they receive. Intero­
perability can involve identifying corresponding components and relationships
in each system, transforming them syntactically to the same format, structurally
to the same granularity, and semantically to the same meaning.
For example, an Internet shopping site might present customers with a product
catalog whose items come from a variety of manufacturers who describe the
same products in different ways. Likewise, the end-to-end process from custom­
er ordering to delivery requires that customer, product and payment informa­
tion pass through the information systems of different firms. Creating the neces­
sary information mappings and transformations is tedious or even impossible if
the components and relationships among them are not formally specified for
each system.
In contrast, when these models exist as data or document schemas or as classes
in programming languages, identifying and exploiting the relationships between
the information in different systems to achieve interoperability or to merge dif­
ferent classification systems can often be completely automated. Because of the
substantial economic benefits to governments, businesses, and their customers
of more efficient information integration and exchange, efforts to standardize
these information models are important in numerous industries. Chapter 10, In­
teractions with Resources will dive deeper into interoperability issues, especially
those that arise in business contexts.

(See §6.3 The Semantic Perspective (page 276) and §6.7.1 Choice of Imple­

that makes every important semantic assumption and property precise and
explicit.
(See §6.3 The Semantic Perspective (page 276))
• Three broad categories of semantic relationships are inclusion, attribution,
and possession.
(See §6.3.1 Types of Semantic Relationships (page 278))
• A set of interconnected class inclusion relationships creates a hierarchy
called a taxonomy.
(See §6.3.1.1 Inclusion (page 279))
• Classification is a class inclusion relationship between an instance and a
class.
(See §6.3.1.1 Inclusion (page 279))
• Ordering and inclusion relationships are inherently transitive, enabling in­
ferences about class membership and properties.
(See §6.3.2.2 Transitivity (page 285))
• Class inclusion relationships form a framework to which other kinds of rela­
tionships attach, creating a network of relationships called an ontology.
(See §6.3.3 Ontologies (page 286))
• When words encode the semantic distinctions expressed by class inclusion,
the more specific class is called the hyponym; the more general class is the
hypernym.
(See §6.4.1.1 Hyponymy and Hyperonymy (page 290))

• Morphological analysis of how words in a language are created from smaller
units is heavily used in text processing.
(See §6.4.3 Relationships among Word Forms (page 293))

al relationships with other resources.
(See §6.5.2 Structural Relationships within a Resource (page 297) and
§6.5.2 Structural Relationships within a Resource (page 297))
• Using the pattern of links between documents to understand the structure of
knowledge and the structure of the intellectual community that creates it is
an idea that is nearly a century old.
(See §6.5.3 Structural Relationships between Resources (page 300))
• Many hypertext links are purely structural because there is no explicit rep­
resentation of the reason for the relationship.

Kent’s Data and Reality was first published in 1978 with a second edi­
tion in 1998. Kent was a well-known and well-liked researcher in data modeling
at IBM, and his book became a cult classic. In 2012, seven years after Kent’s
death, a third edition (Kent and Hoberman 2012) came out, slightly revised and
annotated but containing essentially the same content as the book from 34
years earlier because its key issues about data modeling are timeless.

“Semantic” is usually defined as “relating to meaning or language”
and that does not seem helpful here.
[312][CogSci]

For decades important and vexing questions have been raised about
the specificity of these predicate-argument associations and how or when the
semantic constraints they embody combine with syntactic and contextual con­
straints during the process of comprehending language. Consider how “While in
the operating room, the surgeon used a knife to cut the ____” generates a differ­
ent expectancy from the same predicate and agent in “While at the fancy res­
taurant, the surgeon used a knife to cut the ____.” See (Elman 2009).

George Miller made many important contributions to the study of mind
and language during his long scientific career. His most famous article, “The
Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two” (Miller 1956), was seminal in its
proposals about information organization in human memory, even though it is
one of the most misquoted scientific papers of all time. Relatively late in his ca­
reer Miller began the WordNet project to build a semantic dictionary, which is
now an essential resource in natural language processing applications. See

there are often much subtler differences in meaning that arise from context.
The verb “save” seems to mean something different in “The shopper saved...”

called different senses.

Languages differ a great deal in morphological complexity and in the na­

morphemes and few grammatical inflections, which leads to a huge number of
homophones. English is pretty average on this scale. A popular textbook on mor­
phology is (Haspelmath and Sims 2010).

English nouns have plural (book/books) and possessive forms (the pro­
fessor’s book), adjectives have comparatives and superlatives (big/bigger/
biggest), and regular verbs have only four inflected forms (see http://cla.calp

noun can have 11 word forms, each adjective 30, and every regular verb over
300 (Anderson 2001).

Before the web, most hypertexts implementations were in stand-alone
applications like CD-ROM encyclopedias or in personal information manage­
ment systems that used “cards” or “notes” as metaphors for the information
units that were linked together, typically using rich taxonomies of link types.
See (Conklin 1987), (Conklin and Begeman 1988), and (DeRose 1989).
[363][Com]

Many of the pre-web hypertext designs of the 1980s and 1990s allowed
for n-ary links. The Dexter hypertext reference model (Halasz and Schwartz
1994) elegantly describes the typical architectures. However, there is some am­
biguity in use of the term binary in hypertext link architectures. One-to-one vs.
one-to-many is a cardinality distinction, and some people reserve binary to dis­
cussion about degree.

See (Weinreich, Obendorf, and Lamersdorf 2001).

Most designers use a variety of visual cues and conventions to distinguish
hyperlinks (e.g., plain hyperlink, button, selectable menu, etc.) so that users can
anticipate how they work and what they mean. A recent counter-trend called
“flat design” —exemplified most notably by the user interfaces of Windows 8
and iOS 7— argues for a minimalist style with less variety in typography, color,
and shading. Flat designs are easier to adapt across multiple devices, but con­
vey less information.

Most web links are very simple in structure. The anchor text in the link­

ence) attribute that contains the URI of the link destination if it is in another
page, or a reference to an ID attribute if the link is to a different part of the
same page. HTML also has a <LINK> tag, which, along with <A> have REL (rela­
tionship) and REV (reverse relationship) attributes that enable the encoding of
typed relationships in links. In a book context for example, link relationships
and reverse relations include obvious candidates such as next, previous, parent,
child, table of contents, bibliography, glossary and index.

Using hypertext links as interaction controls is the modern dynamic
manifestation of cross references between textual commentary and illustrations
in books, a mechanism that dates from the 1500s (Kilgour 1998). Hypertext

ing REL and REV attributes, but browsers still do not provide useful interactions
for link relations.

7.1 Introduction
For nearly two decades, a TV game show called Pyramid aired in North Ameri­
ca. The show featured two competing teams, each team consisting of two con­
testants: an ordinary civilian contestant and a celebrity. In the show’s first
round, both teams’ members viewed a pyramid-shaped sign that displayed six
category titles, some straightforward like “Where You Live” and others less con­
ventional like “Things You Need to Feed.” Each team then had an opportunity to
compete for points in 30-second turns. The goal was for one team member to
gain points by identifying a word or phrase related to the category from clues
provided by the other team member. For example, a target phrase for the
“Where You Live” category might be “zip code,” and the clue might be “Mine is
94705.” “Things you Need to Feed” might include both “screaming baby” and
“parking meter.”

The Discipline of Organizing

The team that won the first round advanced to the “Winner’s Circle,” where the
game was turned around. This time, only the clue giver was shown the category
name and had to suggest concepts or instances belonging to that category so
that the teammate could guess the category name. Clues like “alto,” “soprano,”
and “tenor” would be given to prompt the teammate to guess “Singing Voices”
or “Types of Singers.”
As the game progressed, the categories became more challenging. It was inter­
esting and entertaining to hear the clue receiver’s initial guess and how subse­
quent guesses changed with more clues. The person giving clues would often
become frustrated, because to them their clues seemed obvious and discrimi­
nating but would seem not to help the clue receivers in identifying the category.
Viewers enjoyed sharing in these moments of vocabulary and category confu­
sion.
The Pyramid TV game show developers created a textbook example for teaching
about categories—groups or classes of things, people, processes, events or any­
thing else that we treat as equivalent—and categorization—the process of as­
signing instances to categories. The game is a useful analog for us to illustrate
many of the issues we discuss in this chapter. The Pyramid game was challeng­
ing, and sometimes comical, because people bring their own experiences and
biases to understanding what a category means, and because not every instance
of a category is equally typical or suggestive. How we organize reflects our
thinking processes, which can inadvertently reveal personal characteristics that
can be amusing in a social context. Hence, the popularity of the Pyramid fran­
chise, which began on CBS in 1973 and has been produced in 20 countries.
Many texts in library science introduce categorization via cataloging rules, a set
of highly prescriptive methods for assigning resources to categories that some
describe and others satirize as “mark ’em and park ’em.” Many texts in comput­
er science discuss the process of defining the categories needed to create, proc­
ess, and store information in terms of programming language constructs:
“here’s how to define an abstract type, and here’s the data type system.” Ma­
chine learning and data science texts explain how categories are created
through statistical analysis of the correlations among the values of features in a
collection or dataset. We take a very different approach in this chapter, but all of
these different perspectives will find their place in it.386[CogSci]

Navigating This Chapter
In the following sections, we discuss how and why we create catego­
ries, reviewing some important work in philosophy, linguistics, and
cognitive psychology to better understand how categories are cre­
ated and used in organizing systems. We discuss how the way we or­
ganize differs when we act as individuals or as members of social,
cultural, or institutional groups (§7.2); later we share principles for
creating categories( §7.3), design choices (§7.4), and implementation
experience (§7.5). Throughout the chapter, we will compare how cat­
egories created by people compare with those created by computer
algorithms. As usual, we close the chapter with a summary of the key
points (§7.6).

7.2 The What and Why of Categories
Categories are equivalence classes, sets or groups of things or abstract entities
that we treat the same. This does not mean that every instance of a category is
identical, only that from some perspective, or for some purpose, we are treating
them as equivalent based on what they have in common. When we consider
something as a member of a category, we are making choices about which of its
properties or roles we are focusing on and which ones we are ignoring. We do
this automatically and unconsciously most of the time, but we can also do it in
an explicit and self-aware way. When we create categories with conscious effort,
we often say that we are creating a model, or just modeling. You should be fa­
miliar with the idea that a model is a set of simplified descriptions or a physical
representation that removes some complexity to emphasize some features or
characteristics and to de-emphasize others.387[CogSci]
When we encounter objects or situations, recognizing them as members of a
category helps us know how to interact with them. For example, when we enter
an unfamiliar building we might need to open or pass through an entryway that
we recognize as a door. We might never have seen that particular door before,
but it has properties and affordances that we know that all doors have; it has a
doorknob or a handle; it allows access to a larger space; it opens and closes. By
mentally assigning this particular door to the “doors” category we distinguish it
from “windows,” a category that also contains objects that sometimes have han­
dles and that open and close, but which we do not normally pass through to en­
ter another space. Categorization judgments are therefore not just about what
is included in a class, but also about what is excluded from a class. Neverthe­
less, the category boundaries are not sharp; a “Dutch door” is divided horizon­
tally in half so that the bottom can be closed like a door while the top can stay
open like a window.
7.2 The What and Why of Categories

325

The Discipline of Organizing

Categories are cognitive and linguistic models for applying prior knowledge;
creating and using categories are essential human activities. Categories enable
us to relate things to each other in terms of similarity and dissimilarity and are
involved whenever we perceive, communicate, analyze, predict, or classify.
Without categories, we would perceive the world as an unorganized blur of
things with no understandable or memorable relation to each other. Every wallentry we encounter would be new to us, and we would have to discover its prop­
erties and supported interactions as though we had never before encountered a
door. Of course, we still often need to identify something as a particular in­
stance, but categories enable us to understand how it is equivalent to other in­
stances. We can interchangeably relate to something as specific as “the wooden
door to the main conference room” or more generally as “any door.”
All human languages and cultures divide up the world into categories. How and
why this takes place has long been debated by philosophers, psychologists and
anthropologists. One explanation for this differentiation is that people recognize
structure in the world, and then create categories of things that “go together”
or are somehow similar. An alternative view says that human minds make sense
of the world by imposing structure on it, and that what goes together or seems
similar is the outcome rather than a cause of categorization. Bulmer framed the
contrast in a memorable way by asking which came first, the chicken (the objec­
tive facts of nature) or the egghead (the role of the human intellect).388[CogSci]
A secondary and more specialized debate going on for the last few decades
among linguists, cognitive scientists, and computer scientists concerns the ex­
tent to which the cognitive mechanisms involved in category formation are spe­
cialized for that purpose rather than more general learning processes.389[CogSci]
Even before they can talk, children behave in ways that suggest they have
formed categories based on shape, color, and other properties they can directly
perceive in physical objects.390[CogSci] People almost effortlessly learn tens of
thousands of categories embodied in the culture and language in which they
grow up. People also rely on their own experiences, preferences, and goals to
adapt these cultural categories or create entirely individual ones that they use
to organize resources that they personally arrange. Later on, through situation­
al training and formal education, people learn to apply systematic and logical
thinking processes so that they can create and understand categories in engi­
neering, logistics, transport, science, law, business, and other institutional con­
texts.
These three contexts of cultural, individual, and institutional categorization
share some core ideas but they emphasize different processes and purposes for
creating categories, so they are a useful distinction.391[CogSci] Cultural categoriza­
tion can be understood as a natural human cognitive ability that serves as a
foundation for both informal and formal organizing systems. Individual categori­

326

zation tends to grow spontaneously out of our personal activities. Institutional
categorization responds to the need for formal coordination and cooperation
within and between companies, governments, and other goal-oriented enterpri­
ses.
In contrast to these three categorization contexts in which categories are cre­
ated by people, computational categories are created by computer programs for
information retrieval, machine learning, predictive analytics, and other applica­
tions. Computational categories are similar to those created by people in some
ways but differ substantially in other ways.

7.2.1 Cultural Categories
Cultural categories are the archetypical form of categories upon which individu­
al and institutional categories are usually based. Cultural categories tend to de­
scribe our everyday experiences of the world and our accumulated cultural
knowledge. Such categories describe objects, events, settings, internal experi­
ences, physical orientation, relationships between entities, and many other as­
pects of human experience. Cultural categories are learned primarily, with little
explicit instruction, through normal exposure of children with their caregivers;
they are associated with language acquisition and language use within particu­
lar cultural contexts.
Two thousand years ago Plato wrote that living species could be identified by
“carving nature at its joints,” the natural boundaries or discontinuities between
types of things where the differences are the largest or most salient. Plato’s
metaphor is intuitively appealing because we can easily come up with examples
of perceptible properties or behaviors of physical things that go together that
make some ways of categorizing them seem more natural than others.392[Phil]
Natural languages rely heavily on nouns to talk about categories of things be­
cause it is useful to have a shorthand way of referring to a set of properties that
co-occur in predictable ways.393[Ling] For example, in English (borrowed from Por­
tuguese) we have a word for “banana” because a particular curved shape,
greenish-yellow or yellow color, and a convenient size tend to co-occur in a fa­
miliar edible object, so it became useful to give it a name. The word “banana”
brings together this configuration of highly interrelated perceptions into a uni­
fied concept so we do not have to refer to bananas by listing their proper­
ties.394[CogSci]
Languages differ a great deal in the words they contain and also in more funda­
mental ways that they require speakers or writers to attend to details about the
world or aspects of experience that another language allows them to ignore.
This idea is often described as linguistic relativity. (See the sidebar, Linguistic
Relativity (page 328).)

7.2 The What and Why of Categories

327

The Discipline of Organizing

Linguistic Relativity
Linguistic diversity led Benjamin Whorf, in the mid-20th century, to propose
an overly strong statement of the relationships among language, culture,
and thought. Whorf argued that the particularities of one’s native language
determine how we think and what we can think about. Among his extreme
ideas was the suggestion that, because some Native American languages
lacked words or grammatical forms that refer to what we call “time” in Eng­
lish, they could not understand the concept. More careful language study
showed both parts of the claim to be completely false.
Nevertheless, even though academic linguists have discredited strong ver­
sions of Whorf’s ideas, less deterministic versions of linguistic relativity
have become influential and help us understand cultural categorization. The
more moderate position was crisply characterized by Roman Jakobson, who
said that “languages differ essentially in what they must convey and not in
what they may convey.” In English one can say “I spent yesterday with a
neighbor.” In languages with grammatical gender, one must choose a word
that identifies the neighbor as male or female.395[Ling]
For example, speakers of the Australian aboriginal language, Guugu Yimithirr,
do not use concepts of left and right, but rather use cardinal directions. Where
in English we might say to a person facing north, “Take a step to your left,” they
would use their term for west. If the person faced south, we would change our
instruction to “right,” but they would still use their term for west. Imagine how
difficult it would be for a speaker of Guugu Yimithirr and a speaker of English to
collaborate in organizing a storage room or a closet.396[CogSci]
It is not controversial to notice that different cultures and language communi­
ties have different experiences and activities that give them contrasting knowl­
edge about particular domains. No one would doubt that university undergradu­
ates in Chicago would think differently about animals than inhabitants of Guate­
malan rain forests, or even that different types of “tree experts” (taxonomists,
landscape workers, foresters, and tree maintenance personnel) would catego­
rize trees differently.397[CogSci]
On the other hand, despite the wide variation in the climates, environments,
and cultures that produce them, at a high level “folk taxonomies” that describe
natural phenomena are surprisingly consistent around the world. Half a century
ago the sociologists Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss observed that the lan­
guage and structure of folk taxonomies mirrors that of human family relation­
ships (e.g., different types of trees might be “siblings,” but animals would be
part of another family entirely). They suggested that framing the world in terms
of familiar human relationships allowed people to understand it more easi­
ly.398[CogSci]
328

Informatics Edition

Anthropologist Brent Berlin, a more recent researcher, concurs with Durkheim
and Mauss’s observation that kinship relations and folk taxonomies are related,
but argues that humans patterned their family structures after the natural
world, not the other way around.399[CogSci]

The Discipline of Organizing

7.2.2 Individual Categories
Individual categories are created in an organizing system to satisfy the ad hoc
requirements that arise from a person’s unique experiences, preferences, and
resource collections. Unlike cultural categories, which usually develop slowly
and last a long time, individual categories are created by intentional activity, in
response to a specific situation, or to solve an emerging organizational chal­
lenge. As a consequence, the categories in individual organizing systems gener­
ally have short lifetimes and rarely outlive the person who created them.
Individual categories draw from cultural categories but differ in two important
ways. First, individual categories sometimes have an imaginative or metaphori­
cal basis that is meaningful to the person who created them but which might
distort or misinterpret cultural categories. Second, individual categories are of­
ten specialized or synthesized versions of cultural categories that capture par­
ticular experiences or personal history. For example, a person who has lived in
China and Mexico, or lived with people from those places, might have highly in­
dividualized categories for foods they like and dislike that incorporate charac­
teristics of both Chinese and Mexican cuisine.
Individual categories in organizing systems also reflect the idiosyncratic set of
household goods, music, books, website bookmarks, or other resources that a
person might have collected over time. The organizing systems for financial re­
cords, personal papers, or email messages often use highly specialized catego­
ries that are shaped by specific tasks to be performed, relationships with other
people, events of personal history, and other highly individualized considera­
tions. Put another way, individual categories are used to organize resource col­
lections that are likely not representative samples of all resources of the type
being collected. If everyone had the same collection of music, books, clothes, or
toys the world would be a boring place.
Traditionally, individual categorization systems were usually not visible to, or
shared with, others, whereas, this has become an increasingly common situa­
tion for people using web-based organizing system for pictures, music, or other
personal resources. On websites like the popular Flickr, Instagram, and You­
Tube sites for photos and videos, people typically use existing cultural catego­
ries to tag their content as well as individual ones that they invent.401[Ling]

7.2.3 Institutional Categories
In contrast to cultural categories that are created and used implicitly, and to in­
dividual categories that are used by people acting alone, institutional categories
are created and used explicitly, and most often by many people in coordination
with each other. Institutional categories are most often created in abstract and
information-intensive domains where unambiguous and precise categories are
needed to regulate and systematize activity, to enable information sharing and
reuse, and to reduce transaction costs. Furthermore, instead of describing the
world as it is, institutional categories are usually defined to change or control
the world by imposing semantic models that are more formal and arbitrary than
those in cultural categories. Laws, regulations, and standards often specify in­
stitutional categories, along with decision rules for assigning resources to new
categories, and behavior rules that prescribe how people must interact with
them. The rigorous definition of institutional categories enables classification:
the systematic assignment of resources to categories in an organizing sys­
tem.402[Law]
Creating institutional categories by more systematic processes than cultural or
individual categories does not ensure that they will be used in systematic and
rational ways, because the reasoning and rationale behind institutional catego­
ries might be unknown to, or ignored by, the people who use them. Likewise,
this way of creating categories does not prevent them from being biased. In­
deed, the goal of institutional categories is often to impose or incentivize biases
in interpretation or behavior. There is no better example of this than the prac­
tice of gerrymandering, designing the boundaries of election districts to give
one political party or ethnic group an advantage.403[Ling](See the sidebar, Gerry­
mandering the Illinois 17th Congressional District (page 332).)
Institutional categorization stands apart from individual categorization primari­
ly because it invariably requires significant efforts to reconcile mismatches be­
tween existing individual categories, where those categories embody useful
working or contextual knowledge that is lost in the move to a formal institution­
al system.404[Bus]
Institutional categorization efforts must also overcome the vagueness and in­
consistency of cultural categories because the former must often conform to
stricter logical standards to support inference and meet legal requirements.
Furthermore, institutional categorization is usually a process that must be ac­
counted for in a budget and staffing plans. While some kinds of institutional cat­
egories can be devised or discovered by computational processes, most of them
are created through the collaboration of many individuals, typically from vari­
ous parts of an organization or from different firms. For example, with the ger­
rymandering case we just discussed, it is important to emphasize that the inputs

The 17th Congressional District in Illinois was dubbed “the rabbit on a

The bizarre boundary was negotiated to create favorable voting constituen­

to these programs and the decisions about districting are controlled by people,
which is why the districts are institutional categories; the programs are simply
tools that make the process more efficient. 405[Bus]
The different business or technical perspectives of the participants are often the
essential ingredients in developing robust categories that can meet carefully
identified requirements. And as requirements change over time, institutional
categories must often change as well, implying version control, compliance test­
ing, and other formal maintenance and governance processes.

7.2.4 A “Categorization Continuum”
As we have seen, the concepts of cultural, individual, and institutional categori­
zation usefully distinguish the primary processes and purposes when people
create categories. However, these three kinds of categories can fuse, clash, and
recombine with each other. Rather than viewing them as having precise bounda­
ries, we might view them as regions on a continuum of categorization activities
and methods.
Consider a few different perspectives on categorizing animals as an example.
Scientific institutions categorize animals according to explicit, principled classi­
fication systems, such as the Linnaean taxonomy that assigns animals to a phy­
lum, class, order, family, genus and species. Cultural categorization practices
cannot be adequately described in terms of a master taxonomy, and are more
fluid, converging with principled taxonomies sometimes, and diverging at other
times. While human beings are classified within the animal kingdom in biologi­
cal classification systems, people are usually not considered animals in most
cultural contexts. Sometimes a scientific designation for human beings, homo
sapiens is even applied to human beings in cultural contexts, since the genusspecies taxonomic designation has influenced cultural conceptions of people
and (other) animals over the years.
Animals are also often culturally categorized as pets or non-pets. The category
“pets” commonly includes dogs, cats, and fish. A pet cat might be categorized at
multiple levels that incorporate individual, cultural, and institutional perspec­
tives on categorization—as an “animal” (cultural/institutional), as a “mammal”
(institutional), as a “domestic short-hair” (institutional) as a “cat” (cultural), and
as a “troublemaker” or a “favorite” (individual), among other possibilities, in ad­
dition to being identified individually by one or more pet names. Furthermore,
not everyone experiences pets as just dogs, cats and fish. Some people have rel­
7.2 The What and Why of Categories

333

atively unusual pets, like pigs. For individuals who have pet pigs or who know
people with pet pigs, “pigs” may be included in the “pets” category. If enough
people have pet pigs, eventually “pigs” could be included in mainstream cul­
ture’s pet category.
Categorization skewed toward cultural perspectives incorporate relatively tradi­
tional categories, such as those learned implicitly from social interactions, like
mainstream understandings of what kinds of animals are “pets,” while categori­
zation skewed toward institutional perspectives emphasizes explicit, formal cat­
egories, like the categories employed in biological classification systems.

7.2.5 Computational Categories
Computational categories are created by computer programs when the number
of resources, or when the number of descriptions or observations associated
with each resource, are so large that people cannot think about them effectively.
Computational categories are created for information retrieval, predictive ana­
lytics, and other applications where information scale or speed requirements
are critical. The resulting categories are similar to those created by people in
some ways but differ substantially in other ways.
The simplest kind of computational categories can be created using descriptive
statistics (see §3.3.4). Descriptive statistics do not identify the categories they
create by giving them familiar cultural or institutional labels. Instead, they cre­
ate implicit categories of items according to how much they differ from the most
typical or frequent ones. For example, in any dataset where the values follow
the normal distribution, statistics of central tendency and dispersion serve as
standard reference measures for any observation. These statistics identify cate­
gories of items that are very different or statistically unlikely outliers, which
could be signals of measurement errors, poorly calibrated equipment, employ­
ees who are inadequately trained or committing fraud, or other problems. The
“Six Sigma” methodology for process improvement and quality control rests on
this idea that careful and consistent collection of statistics can make any meas­
urable operation better.
Many text processing methods and applications use simple statistics to catego­
rize words by their frequency in a language, in a collection of documents, or in
individual documents, and these categories are exploited in many information
retrieval applications (see §10.4.1 and §10.4.2).
Categories that people create and label also can be used more explicitly in com­
putational algorithms and applications. In particular, a program that can assign
an item or instance to one or more existing categories is called a classifier. The
subfield of computer science known as machine learning is home to numerous
techniques for creating classifiers by training them with already correctly cate­
gorized examples. This training is called supervised learning; it is supervised

CAFE Standards: Blurring the Lines Between Categorization
Perspectives
The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards sort vehicles into
“passenger car” and “light truck” categories and impose higher minimum
fuel efficiency requirements for cars because trucks have different typical
uses.
When CAFE standards were introduced, the vehicles classified as light
trucks were generally used for “light duty” farming and manufacturing pur­
poses. “Light trucks” might be thought of as a “sort of” in-between category
—a light truck is not really a car, but sufficiently unlike a prototypical truck
to qualify the vehicle’s categorization as “light.” Formalizing this sense of
in-between-ness by specifying features that define a “car” and a “light
truck” is the only way to implement a consistent, transparent fuel efficiency
policy that makes use of informal, graded distinctions between vehicles.
A manufacturer whose average fuel economy for all the vehicles it sells in a
year falls below the CAFE standards has to pay penalties. This encourages
them to produce “sport utility vehicles” (SUVs) that adhere to the CAFE def­
initions of light trucks but which most people use as passenger cars. Simi­
larly, the PT Cruiser, a retro-styled hatchback produced by Chrysler from
2000-2010, strikes many people as a car. It looks like a car; we associate it
with the transport of passengers rather than with farming; and in fact it is
formally classified as a car under emissions standards. But like SUVs, in the
CAFE classification system, the PT Cruiser is a light truck.
CAFE standards have evolved over time, becoming a theater for political
clashes between holistic cultural categories and formal institutional catego­
ries, which plays out in competing pressures from industry, government,
and political organizations. Furthermore, CAFE standards and manufactur­
ers’ response to them are influencing cultural categories, such that our cul­
tural understanding of what a car looks like is changing over time as manu­
facturers design vehicles like the PT Cruiser with car functionality in uncon­
ventional shapes to take advantage of the CAFE light truck specifica­
tions.407[Bus]
because it starts with instances labeled by category, and it involves learning be­
cause over time the classifier improves its performance by adjusting the weights
for features that distinguish the categories. But strictly speaking, supervised
learning techniques do not learn the categories; they implement and apply cate­
gories that they inherit or are given to them. We will further discuss the compu­
tational implementation of categories created by people in §7.5.

7.2 The What and Why of Categories

The Discipline of Organizing

Supervised and Unsupervised
Learning
Two subfields of machine learning
that are relevant to organizing sys­
tems are supervised and unsuper­
vised learning. In supervised learn­
ing, a machine learning program is
trained with sample items or docu­
ments that are labeled by category,
and the program learns to assign
new items to the correct categories.
In unsupervised learning, the pro­
gram gets the same items but has
to come up with the categories on
its own by discovering the underly­
ing correlations between the items;
that is why unsupervised learning is
sometimes called statistical pattern
recognition.

In contrast, many computational tech­
niques in machine learning can ana­
lyze a collection of resources to dis­
cover statistical regularities or corre­
lations among the items, creating a
set of categories without any labeled
training data. This is called unsuper­
vised learning or statistical pattern
recognition. As we pointed out in
§7.2.1 Cultural Categories (page 327),
we learn most of our cultural catego­
ries without any explicit instruction
about them, so it is not surprising
that computational models of catego­
rization developed by cognitive scien­
tists often employ unsupervised stat­
istical learning methods.

Many computational categories are
like individual categories because
they are tied to specific collections of
resources or data and are designed to
satisfy narrow goals. The individual categories you use to organize your email
inbox or the files on your computer reflect your specific interests, activities, and
personal network and are surely different than those of anyone else. Similarly,
your credit card company analyzes your specific transactions to create computa­
tional categories of “likely good” and “likely fraudulent” that are different for
every cardholder.
This focused scope is obvious when we consider how we might describe a com­
putational
category.
“Fraudulent
transaction
for
cardholder
4264123456780123” is not lexicalized with a one-word label as familiar cultural
categories are. “Door” and “window” have broad scopes that are not tied to a
single purpose. Put another way, the “door” and “window” cultural categories
are highly reusable, as are institutional categories like those used to collect eco­
nomic or health data that can be analyzed for many different purposes. The defi­
nitions of “door” and “window” might be a little fuzzy, but institutional catego­
ries are more precisely defined, often by law or regulation. Examples are the
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) from the US Census Bu­
reau and the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPC).
A final contrast between categories created by people and those created compu­
tationally is that the former can almost always be inspected and reasoned about
by other people, but only some of the latter can. A computational model that
categorizes loan applicants as good or poor credit risks probably uses proper­
336

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

ties like age, income, home address, and marital status, so that a banker can un­
derstand and explain a credit decision. However, many other computational cat­
egories, especially those that created by clustering and deep learning techni­
ques, are inseparable from the mathematical model that learned to use them,
and as a result are uninterpretable by people.
A machine learning algorithm for classifying objects in images creates a com­
plex multi-layer neural network whose features have no clear relationship to the
categories, and this network has no other use. Put another way, machine learn­
ing programs are very general because they can be employed in any domain
with high dimensional data, but what they learn cannot be applied in any other
domain.

7.3 Principles for Creating Categories
§7.2 The What and Why of Categories (page 325) explained what categories are
and the contrasting cultural, individual, and institutional contexts and purposes
for which categories are created. In doing so, a number of different principles
for creating categories were mentioned, mostly in passing.
We now take a systematic look at principles for creating categories, including:
enumeration, single properties, multiple properties and hierarchy, probabilistic,
similarity, and theory- and goal-based categorization. These ways of creating
categories differ in the information and mechanisms they use to determine cate­
gory membership.

7.3.1 Enumeration
The simplest principle for creating a category is enumeration; any resource in a
finite or countable set can be deemed a category member by that fact alone.
This principle is also known as extensional definition, and the members of the
set are called the extension. Many institutional categories are defined by enu­
meration as a set of possible or legal values, like the 50 United States or the
ISO currency codes (ISO 4217).
Enumerative categories enable membership to be unambiguously determined
because a value like state name or currency code is either a member of the cat­
egory or it is not. However, this clarity has a downside; it makes it hard to argue
that something not explicitly mentioned in an enumeration should be considered
a member of the category, which can make laws or regulations inflexible. More­
over, there comes a size when enumerative definition is impractical or ineffi­
cient, and the category either must be sub-divided or be given a definition based
on principles other than enumeration.408[Law]
For example, for millennia we earthlings have had a cultural category of “plan­
et” as a “wandering” celestial object, and because we only knew of planets in

Too Many Planets to
Enumerate: Keeping up with
Kepler
Kepler is a space observatory
launched by NASA in 2009 to
search for Earth-like planets orbit­
ing other stars in our own Milky
Way galaxy. Kepler has already dis­
covered and verified a few thousand
new planets, and these results have
led to estimates that there may be
at least as many planets as there
are stars, a few hundred billion in
the Milky Way alone. Count fast.

our own solar system, the planet cate­
gory was defined by enumeration:
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn. When the outer planets of
Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were
identified as planets in the 18th-20th
centuries, they were added to this list
of planets without any changes in the
cultural category. But in the last cou­
ple of decades many heretofore un­
known planets outside our solar sys­
tem have been detected, making the
set of planets unbounded, and defini­
tion by enumeration no longer works.

The International Astronomical Un­
ion (IAU) thought it solved this cate­
gory crisis by proposing a definition of planet as “a celestial body that is (a) in
orbit around a star, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid
body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape,
and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.” Unfortunately, Pluto
does not satisfy the third requirement, so it no longer is a member of the planet
category, and instead is now called an “inferior planet.”
Changing the definition of a significant cultural category generated a great deal
of controversy and angst among ordinary non-scientific people. A typical head­
line was “Pluto’s demotion has schools spinning,” describing the outcry from el­
ementary school students and teachers about the injustice done to Pluto and the
disruption on the curriculum.

7.3.2 Single Properties
It is intuitive and useful to think in terms of properties when we identify instan­
ces and when we are describing instances (as we saw in §4.3 Resource Identity
(page 182) and in Chapter 5, Resource Description and Metadata). Therefore, it
should also be intuitive and useful to consider properties when we analyze more
than one instance to compare and contrast them so we can determine which
sets of instances can be treated as a category or equivalence class. Categories
whose members are determined by one or more properties or rules follow the
principle of intensional definition, and the defining properties are called the in­
tension.
You might be thinking here that enumeration or extensional definition of a cate­
gory is also a property test; is not “being a state” a property of California? But
statehood is not a property precisely because “state” is defined by extension,

338

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

Informatics Edition

which means the only way to test California for statehood is to see if it is in the
list of states.410[Phil]
Any single property of a resource can be used to create categories, and the easi­
est ones to use are often the intrinsic static properties. As we discussed in
Chapter 5, Resource Description and Metadata, intrinsic static properties are
those inherent in a resource that never change. The material of composition of
natural or manufactured objects is an intrinsic and static property that can be
used to arrange physical resources. For example, an organizing system for a
personal collection of music that is based on the intrinsic static property of
physical format might use categories for CDs, DVDs, vinyl albums, 8-track car­
tridges, reel-to-reel tape and tape cassettes.411[CogSci]
Using a single property is most natural to do when the properties can take on
only a small set of discrete values like music formats, and especially when the
property is closely related to how the resources are used, as they are with the
music collection where each format requires different equipment to listen to the
music. Each value then becomes a subcategory of the music category.
The author, date, and location of creation of an intellectual resource cannot be
directly perceived but they are also intrinsic static properties. The subject mat­
ter or purpose of a resource, its “what it is about” or “what it was originally for,”
are also intrinsic static properties that are not directly perceivable, especially
for information resources.
The name or identifier of a resource is often arbitrary but once assigned nor­
mally does not change, making it an extrinsic static property. Any collection of
resources with alphabetic or numeric identifiers as an associated property can
use sorting order as an organizing principle to arrange spices, books, personnel
records, etc., in a completely reliable way. Some might argue whether this or­
ganizing principle creates a category system, or whether it simply exploits the
ordering inherent in the identifier notation. For example, with alphabetic identi­
fiers, we can think of alphabetic ordering as creating a recursive category sys­
tem with 26 (A-Z) top-level categories, each containing the same number of
second-level categories, and so on until every instance is assigned to its proper
place.412[CogSci]
Some resource properties are both extrinsic and dynamic because they are
based on usage or behaviors that can be highly context-dependent. The current
owner or location of a resource, its frequency of access, the joint frequency of
access with other resources, or its current rating or preference with respect to
alternative resources are typical extrinsic and dynamic properties that can be
the basis for arranging resources and defining categories.
These properties can have a large number of values or are continuous meas­
ures, but as long as there are explicit rules for using property values to deter­

7.3 Principles for Creating Categories

339

The Discipline of Organizing

mine category assignment the resulting categories are still easy to understand
and use. For example, we naturally categorize people we know on the basis of
their current profession, the city where they live, their hobbies, or their age.
Properties with a numerical dimension like “frequency of use” are often trans­
formed into a small set of categories like “frequently used,” “occasionally used,”
and “rarely used” based on the numerical property values.413[CogSci]
While there are an infinite number of logically expressible properties for any re­
source, most of them would not lead to categories that would be interpretable
and useful for people. If people are going to use the categories, it is important
to base them on properties that are psychologically or pragmatically relevant
for the resource domain being categorized. Whether something weighs more or
less than 5000 pounds is a poor property to apply to things in general, because
it puts cats and chairs in one category, and buses and elephants in anoth­
er.414[CogSci]
To summarize: The most useful single properties to use for creating categories
for an organizing system used by people are those that are formally assigned,
objectively measurable and orderable, or tied to well-established cultural cate­
gories, because the resulting categories will be easier to understand and de­
scribe.
If only a single property is used to distinguish among some set of resources and
to create the categories in an organizing system, the choice of property is criti­
cal because different properties often lead to different categories. Using the age
property, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are unlikely to end up in the same
category of people. Using the wealth property, they most certainly would. Fur­
thermore, if only one property is used to create a system of categories, any cate­
gory with a large numbers of items in it will lack coherence because differences
on other properties will be too apparent, and some category members will not
fit as well as the others.

7.3.3 Multiple Properties
Organizing systems often use multiple properties to define categories. There
are three different ways in which to do this that differ in the scope of the prop­
erties and how essential they are in defining the categories.

7.3.3.1 Multi-Level or Hierarchical Categories
If you have many shirts in your closet (and you are a bit compulsive or a “neat
freak”), instead of just separating your shirts from your pants using a single
property (the part of body on which the clothes are worn) you might arrange the
shirts by style, and then by sleeve length, and finally by color. When all of the
resources in an organizing system are arranged using the same sequence of re­

340

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

Informatics Edition

source properties, this creates a logical hierarchy, a multi-level category sys­
tem.
If we treat all the shirts as the collection being organized, in the shirt organiz­
ing system the broad category of shirts is first divided by style into categories
like “dress shirts,” “work shirts,” “party shirts,” and “athletic or sweatshirts.”
Each of these style categories is further divided until the categories are very
narrow ones, like the “white long-sleeve dress shirts” category. A particular
shirt ends up in this last category only after passing a series of property tests
along the way: it is a dress shirt, it has long sleeves, and it is white. Each test
creates more precise categories in the intersections of the categories whose
members passed the prior property tests.
Put another way, each subdivision of a category takes place when we identify or
choose a property that differentiates the members of the category in a way that
is important or useful for some intent or purpose. Shirts differ from pants in the
value of the “part of body” property, and all the shirt subcategories share this
“top part” value of that property. However, shirts differ on other properties that
determine the subcategory to which they belong. Even as we pay attention to
these differentiating properties, it is important to remember the other proper­
ties, the ones that members of a category at any level in the hierarchy have in
common with the members of the categories that contain it. These properties
are often described as “inherited” or “inferred” from the broader catego­
ry.415[Com] For example, just as every shirt shares the “worn on top part of body”
property, every item of clothing shares the “can be worn on the body” property,
and every resource in the “shirts” and “pants” category inherits that property.
Each differentiating property creates another level in the category hierarchy,
which raises an obvious question: How many properties and levels do we need?
In order to answer this question we must reflect upon the shirt categories in our
closet. Our organizing system for shirts arranges them with the three properties
of style, sleeve length, and color; some of the categories at the lowest level of
the resulting hierarchy might have only one member, or no members at all. You
might have yellow or red short-sleeved party shirts, but probably do not have
yellow or red long-sleeved dress shirts, making them empty categories. Obvi­
ously, any category with only one member does not need any additional proper­
ties to tell the members apart, so a category hierarchy is logically complete if
every resource is in a category by itself.
However, even when the lowest level categories of our shirt organizing system
have more than one member, we might choose not to use additional properties
to subdivide it because the differences that remain among the members do not
matter to us for the interactions the organizing system needs to support. Sup­
pose we have two long-sleeve white dress shirts from different shirt makers, but
whenever we need to wear one of them, we ignore this property. Instead, we

7.3 Principles for Creating Categories

341

The Discipline of Organizing

just pick one or the other, treating the shirts as completely equivalent or substi­
tutable. When the remaining differences between members of a category do not
make a difference to the users of the category, we can say that the organizing
system is pragmatically or practically complete even if it is not yet logically
complete. That is to say, it is complete “for all intents and purposes.” Indeed, we
might argue that it is desirable to stop subdividing a system of categories while
there are some small differences remaining among the items in each category
because this leaves some flexibility or logical space in which to organize new
items. This point might remind you of the concept of overfitting, where models
with many parameters can very accurately fit their training data, but as a result
generalize less well to new data. (See §5.3.2.5.)
On the other hand, consider the shirt section of a big department store. Shirts
there might be organized by style, sleeve length, and color as they are in our
home closet, but would certainly be further organized by shirt maker and by
size to enable a shopper to find a Marc Jacobs long-sleeve blue dress shirt of
size 15/35. The department store organizing system needs more properties and
a deeper hierarchy for the shirt domain because it has a much larger number of
shirt instances to organize and because it needs to support many shirt shop­
pers, not just one person whose shirts are all the same size.

7.3.3.2 Different Properties for Subsets of Resources
A different way to use multiple resource properties to create categories in an
organizing system is to employ different properties for distinct subsets of the re­
sources being organized. This contrasts with the strict multi-level approach in
which every resource is evaluated with respect to every property. Alternatively,
we could view this principle as a way of organizing multiple domains that are
conceptually or physically adjacent, each of which has a separate set of catego­
ries based on properties of the resources in that domain. This principle is used
for most folder structures in computer file systems and by many email applica­
tions; you can create as many folder categories as you want, but any resource
can only be placed in one folder.
The contrasts between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, and between static and
dynamic ones, are helpful in explaining this method of creating organizing cate­
gories. For example, you might organize all of your clothes using intrinsic static
properties if you keep your shirts, socks, and sweaters in different drawers and
arrange them by color; extrinsic static properties if you share your front hall
closet with a roommate, so you each use only one side of that closet space; in­
trinsic dynamic properties if you arrange your clothes for ready access accord­
ing to the season; and, extrinsic dynamic properties if you keep your most fre­

Classifying Hawaiian “Boardshorts”

The swimsuits worn by surfers, called “boardshorts,” have evolved from
purely functional garments to symbols of extreme sports and the Hawaiian
lifestyle. A 2012 exhibition at the Honolulu Museum of Art captured the di­
versity of boardshorts on three facets: their material, how they fastened
around the surfer’s fly and waist, and their length.

If we relax the requirement that different subsets of resources use different or­
ganizing properties and allow any property to be used to describe any resource,
the loose organizing principle we now have is often called tagging. Using any
property of a resource to create a description is an uncontrolled and often un­
principled principle for creating categories, but it is increasingly popular for or­
ganizing photos, web sites, email messages in gmail, or other web-based resour­
ces. We discuss tagging in more detail in §5.2.2.3 Tagging of Web-based Resour­
ces (page 222).

A Supermarket Map

A typical supermarket embodies a surprisingly complex classification sys­
tem. Each section of the store employs a different set of properties to ar­
range its resources, and some properties such as perishability and onsite
preparation are important in more than one section.

7.3.3.3 Necessary and Sufficient Properties
A large set of resources does not always require many properties and categories
to organize it. Some types of categories can be defined precisely with just a few
essential properties. For example, a prime number is a positive integer that has
no divisors other than 1 and itself, and this category definition perfectly distin­
guishes prime and not-prime numbers no matter how many numbers are being
categorized. “Positive integer” and “divisible only by 1 and itself” are necessary
or defining properties for the prime number category; every prime number must
satisfy these properties. These properties are also sufficient to establish mem­
bership in the prime number category; any number that satisfies the necessary
properties is a prime number. Categories defined by necessary and sufficient
properties are also called monothetic. They are also sometimes called classical
344

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

categories because they conform to Aristotle’s theory of how categories are
used in logical deduction using syllogisms.417[Phil] (See the sidebar, The Classical
View of Categories (page 345).)
Theories of categorization have evolved a great deal since Plato and Aristotle
proposed them over two thousand years ago, but in many ways we still adhere
to classical views of categories when we create organizing systems because
they can be easier to implement and maintain that way.
An important implication of necessary and sufficient category definition is that
every member of the category is an equally good member or example of the cat­
egory; every prime number is equally prime. Institutional category systems of­
ten employ necessary and sufficient properties for their conceptual simplicity
and straightforward implementation in decision trees, database schemas,and
programming language classes.

The Classical View of Categories
The classical view is that categories are defined by necessary and sufficient
properties. This theory has been enormously influential in Western thought,
and is embodied in many organizing systems, especially those for informa­
tion resources. However, as we will explain, we cannot rely on this principle
to create categories in many domains and contexts because there are not
necessary and sufficient properties. As a result, many psychologists, cogni­
tive scientists, and computer scientists who think about categorization have
criticized the classical theory.
We think this is unfair to Aristotle, who proposed what we now call the clas­
sical theory primarily to explain how categories underlie the logic of deduc­
tive reasoning: All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Therefore, Socrates is
mortal. People are wrong to turn Aristotle’s thinking around and apply it to
the problem of inductive reasoning, how categories are created in the first
place. But this is not Aristotle’s fault; he was not trying to explain how natu­
ral cultural categories arise.
Consider the definition of an address as requiring a street, city, governmental
region, and postal code. Anything that has all of these information components
is therefore considered to be a valid address, and anything that lacks any of
them will not be considered to be a valid address. If we refine the properties of
an address to require the governmental region to be a state, and specifically
one of the United States Postal Service’s list of official state and territory codes,
we create a subcategory for US addresses that uses an enumerated category as
part of its definition. Similarly, we could create a subcategory for Canadian ad­
dresses by exchanging the name “province” for state, and using an enumerated
list of Canadian province and territory codes.

7.3.4 The Limits of Property-Based Categorization
Property-based categorization works tautologically well for categories like
“prime number” where the category is defined by necessary and sufficient prop­
erties. Property-based categorization also works well when properties are con­
ceptually distinct and the value of a property is easy to perceive and examine,
as they are with man-made physical resources like shirts.
Historical experience with organizing systems that need to categorize informa­
tion resources has shown that basing categories on easily perceived properties
is often not effective. There might be indications “on the surface” that suggest
the “joints” or boundaries between types of information resources, but these are
often just presentation or packaging choices, That is to say, neither the size of a
book nor the color of its cover are reliable cues for what it contains. Information
resources have numerous descriptive properties like their title, author, and pub­
lisher that can be used more effectively to define categories, and these are cer­
tainly useful for some kinds of interactions, like finding all of the books written
by a particular author or published by the same publisher. However, for practi­
cal purposes, the most useful property of an information resource is its about­
ness, which may not be objectively perceivable and which is certainly hard to
characterize. Any collection of information resources in a library or document
filing system is likely to be about many subjects and topics, and when an indi­
vidual resource is categorized according to a limited number of its content prop­
erties, it is at the same time not being categorized using the others.
When the web first started, there were many attempts to create categories of
web sites, most notably by Yahoo! As the web grew, it became obvious that
search engines would be vastly more useful because their near real-time text in­
dexes obviate the need for a priori assignment of web pages to categories. Rath­
er, web search engines represent each web page or document in a way that
treats each word or term they contain as a separate property.
Considering every distinct word in a document stretches our notion of property
to make it very different from the kinds of properties we have discussed so far,
where properties were being explicitly used by people to make decisions about
category membership and resource organization. It is just not possible for peo­
ple to pay attention to more than a few properties at the same time even if they
want to, because that is how human perceptual and cognitive machinery works.
But computers have no such limitations, and algorithms for information retriev­
al and machine learning can use huge numbers of properties, as we will see lat­
er in this chapter and in Chapter 8 and Chapter 10.

7.3.5 Probabilistic Categories and “Family Resemblance”
As we have seen, some categories can be precisely defined using necessary and
sufficient features, especially when the properties that determine category
membership are easy to observe and evaluate. Something is either a prime num­
ber or it isn’t. A person cannot be a registered student and not registered at the
same time.
However, categorization based on explicit and logical consideration of proper­
ties is much less effective, and sometimes not even possible for domains where
properties lack one or more of the characteristics of separability, perceptibility,
and necessity. Instead, we need to categorize using properties in a probabilistic
or statistical way to come up with some measure of resemblance or similarity
between the resource to be categorized and the other members of the category.
Consider a familiar category like “bird.” All birds have feathers, wings, beaks,
and two legs. But there are thousands of types of birds, and they are distin­
guished by properties that some birds have that other birds lack: most birds can
fly, most are active in the daytime, some swim, some swim underwater; some
have webbed feet. These properties are correlated or clustered, a consequence
of natural selection that conveys advantages to particular configurations of
characteristics, and there are many different clusters; birds that live in trees
have different wings and feet than those that swim, and birds that live in de­
serts have different colorations and metabolisms that those that live near water.
So instead of being defined by a single set of properties that are both necessary
and sufficient, the bird category is defined probabilistically, which means that
decisions about category membership are made by accumulating evidence from
the properties that are more or less characteristic of the category.
Categories of information resources often have the same probabilistic character.
The category of spam messages is suggested by the presence of particular
words (beneficiary, pharmaceutical) but these words also occur in messages
that are not spam. A spam classifier uses the probabilities of each word in a
message in spam and non-spam contexts to calculate an overall likelihood that
the message is spam.
There are three related consequences for categories when their characteristic
properties have a probabilistic distribution:
• The first is an effect of typicality or centrality that makes some members of
the category better examples than others. Membership in probabilistic cate­
gories is not all or none, so even if they share many properties, an instance
that has more of the characteristic properties will be judged as better or
more typical.419[CogSci] Try to define “bird” and then ask yourself if all of the
things you classify as birds are equally good examples of the category (look

at the six birds in Family Resemblance and Typicality (page 350)). This effect
is also described as gradience in category membership and reflects the ex­
tent to which the most characteristic properties are shared.
• A second consequence is that the sharing of some but not all properties cre­
ates what we call family resemblances among the category members; just as
biological family members do not necessarily all share a single set of physi­
cal features but still are recognizable as members of the same family. This
idea was first proposed by the 20th-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgen­
stein, who used “games” as an example of a category whose members re­
semble each other according to shifting property subsets.420[Phil]
• The third consequence, when categories do not have necessary features for
membership, is that the boundaries of the category are not fixed; the catego­
ry can be stretched and new members assigned as long as they resemble in­
cumbent members. Personal video games and multiplayer online games like
World of Warcraft did not exist in Wittgenstein’s time but we have no trouble
recognizing them as games and neither would Wittgenstein, were he alive.
Recall that in Chapter 1 we pointed out that the cultural category of “li­
brary” has been repeatedly extended by new properties, as when Flickr is
described as a web-based photo-sharing library. Categories defined by family
resemblance or multiple and shifting property sets are termed polythetic.

What Is a Game?
Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) was a philosopher who thought deeply
about mathematics, the mind, and language. In 1999, his Philosophical In­
vestigations was ranked as the most important book of 20th-century philos­
ophy in a poll of philosophers.421[Phil] In that book, Wittgenstein uses “game”
to argue that many concepts have no defining properties, and that instead
there is a “complicated network of similarities overlapping and crisscrossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail.”
He contrasts board games, card games, ball games, games of skill, games of
luck, games with competition, solitary games, and games for amusement.
Wittgenstein notes that not all games are equally good examples of the cate­
gory, and jokes about teaching children a gambling game with dice because
he knows that this is not the kind of game that the parents were thinking of
when they asked him to teach their children a game.422[Phil]
We conclude that instead of using properties one at a time to assign category
membership, we can use them in a composite or integrated way where together
a co-occurring cluster of properties provides evidence that contributes to a simi­
larity calculation. Something is categorized as an A and not a B if it is more sim­
ilar to A’s best or most typical member rather than it is to B’s.423[CogSci]

7.3.6 Similarity
Similarity is a measure of the resemblance between two things that share some
characteristics but are not identical. It is a very flexible notion whose meaning
depends on the domain within which we apply it. Some people consider that the
concept of similarity is itself meaningless because there must always be some
basis, some unstated set of properties, for determining whether two things are
similar. If we could identify those properties and how they are used, there would
not be any work for a similarity mechanism to do.424[CogSci]
To make similarity a useful mechanism for categorization we have to specify
how the similarity measure is determined. There are four psychologicallymotivated approaches that propose different functions for computing similarity:
feature- or property-based, geometry-based, transformational, and alignmentor analogy-based. The big contrast here is between models that represent items
as sets of properties or discrete conceptual features, and those that assume that
properties vary on a continuous metric space.425[CogSci]

7.3.6.1 Feature-based Models of Similarity
An influential model of feature-based similarity calculation is Amos Tversky’s
contrast model, which matches the features or properties of two things and
computes a similarity measure according to three sets of features:
• those features they share,
• those features that the first has that the second lacks, and
• those features that the second has that the first lacks.
The similarity based on the shared features is reduced by the two sets of dis­
tinctive ones. The weights assigned to each set can be adjusted to explain judg­
ments of category membership. Another commonly feature-based similarity
measure is the Jaccard coefficient, the ratio of the common features to the total
number of them. This simple calculation equals zero if there are no overlapping
features and one if all features overlap. Jaccard's measure is often used to cal­
culate document similarity by treating each word as a feature.426[CogSci]
We often use a heuristic version of feature-based similarity calculation when we
create multi-level or hierarchical category systems to ensure that the categories
at each level are at the same level of abstraction or breadth. For example, if we
were organizing a collection of musical instruments, it would not seem correct
to have subcategories of “woodwind instruments,” “violins,” and “cellos” be­
cause the feature-based similarity among the categories is not the same for all
pairwise comparisons among the categories; violins and cellos are simply too
similar to each other to be separate categories given woodwinds as a category.

7.3.6.2 Geometric Models of Similarity
Geometric models are a type of similarity framework in which items whose
property values are metric are represented as points in a multi-dimensional
feature- or property-space. The property values are the coordinates, and similar­
ity is calculated by measuring the distance between the items.
Geometric similarity functions
are commonly used by search
engines; if a query and docu­
ment are each represented as
a vector of search terms, rele­
vance is determined by the
distance between the vectors
in the “term space.” The sim­
plified diagram in the sidebar,
Document Similarity (page
352), depicts four documents
whose locations in the term
space are determined by how
many of each of three terms
they contain. The document
vectors
are normalized to

sible to use the cosine of the
angle between any two docu­
ments as a measure of their similarity. Documents d1 and d2 are more similar to
each other than documents d3 and d4, because angle between the former pair
(Θ) is smaller than the angle between the latter (Φ). We will discuss how this
works in greater detail in Chapter 10, Interactions with Resources.

Document Similarity

If the vectors that represent items in a multi-dimensional property space are of
different lengths, instead of calculating similarity using cosines we need to cal­
culate similarity in a way that more explicitly considers the differences on each
dimension.

The diagram in the sidebar,
Geometric Distance Functions
(page 353) shows two differ­
ent ways of calculating the
distance between points 1
and 2 using the differences A
and B. The Euclidean dis­
tance function takes the
square root of the sum of the
squared differences on each
dimension; in two dimensions,
this is the familiar Pythagor­
ean Theorem to calculate the
length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle, where the ex­
ponent applied to the differ­
ences is 2. In contrast, the

sion.
tances in cities with “gridlike”
street plans, simply adds up
the differences on each dimension, which is equivalent to an exponent of 1.

Geometric Distance Functions

We can interpret the exponent as a weighting function that determines the rela­
tive contribution of each property to the overall distance or similarity calcula­
tion. The choice of exponent depends on the type of properties that characterize
a domain and how people make category judgments within it. The exponent of 1
in the City Block function ensures that each property contributes its full
amount. As the exponent grows larger, it magnifies the impact of the properties
on which differences are the largest.
The Chebyshev function takes this to the limit (where the exponent would be
infinity) and defines the distance between two items as the difference of their
values on the single property with the greatest difference. What this means in
practice is that two items could have similar or even identical values on most
properties, but if they differ much on just one property, they will be treated as
very dissimilar. We can make an analogy to stereotyping or prejudice when a
person is just like you in all ways except for the one property you view as nega­
tive, which then becomes the only one that matters to you.
At the other extreme, if the exponent is reduced to zero, this treats each proper­
ty as binary, either present or absent, and the distance function becomes a
count of the number of times that the value of the property for one item is dif­
ferent from the value for the other one. This is called the “Hamming distance.”

7.3.6.3 Transformational Models of Similarity
Transformational models assume that the similarity between two things is inver­
sely proportional to the complexity of the transformation required to turn one
into the other. The simplest transformational model of similarity counts the
number of properties that would need to change their values. More generally,
one way to perform the name matching task of determining when two different
strings denote the same person, object, or other named entity is to calculate the
“edit distance” between them; the number of changes required to transform one
into the other.
The simplest calculation just counts the number of insertion, deletion, and sub­
stitution operations and is called the Levenshtein distance; for example, the dis­
tance between “bob” and “book” is two: insert “o” and change the second “b” to
“k”. Two strings with a short edit distance might be variant spellings or mis­
spellings of the same name, and transformational models that are sensitive to
common typing errors like transposed or duplicated letters are very effective at
spelling correction. Transformational models of similarity are also commonly
used to detect plagiarism and duplicate web pages.427[Com]

7.3.6.4 Alignment or Analogy Models of Similarity
None of the previous types of similarity models works very well when compar­
ing things that have lots of internal or relational structure. In these cases, calcu­
lations based on matching features is insufficient; you need to compare features
that align because they have the same role in structures or relationships. For
example, a car with a green wheel and a truck with a green hood both share the
feature green, but this matching feature does not increase their similarity much
because the car's wheel does not align with the truck's hood. On the other hand,
analogy lets us say that an atom is like the solar system. They have no common
properties, but they share the relationship of having smaller objects revolving
around a large one.
This kind of analogical comparison is especially important in problem solving.
You might think that experts are good at solving problems in their domain of ex­
pertise because they have organized their knowledge and experience in ways
that enable efficient search for and evaluation of possible solutions. For exam­
ple, it is well known that chess masters search their memories of previous win­
ning positions and the associated moves to decide what to play. However, top
chess players also organize their knowledge and select moves on the basis of
abstract similarities that cannot be explained in terms of specific positions of
chess pieces. This idea that experts represent and solve problems at deeper lev­
els than novices do by using more abstract principles or domain structure has
been replicated in many areas. Novices tend to focus more on surface proper­
ties and rely more on literal similarity.428[CogSci]

7.3.7 Goal-Derived Categories
Another psychological principle for creating categories is to organize resources
that go together in order to satisfy a goal. Consider the category “Things to take
from a burning house,” an example that cognitive scientist Lawrence Barsalou
termed an ad hoc or goal-derived category.429[CogSci]
What things would you take from your
house if a fire threatened it?? Possibly
your cat, your wallet and checkbook,
important papers like birth certifi­
cates and passports, and grandma’s
old photo album, and anything else
you think is important, priceless, or
irreplaceable—as long as you can car­
ry it. These items have no discernible
properties in common, except for be­
ing your most precious possessions.
The category is derived or induced by
a particular goal in some specified
context.

7.3.8 Theory-Based Categories

Things Used at the Gym

A hand towel, a music player with
headphones, and a bottle of water
have no properties in common but
they go together because they are
members of the “things used at the
gym when working out” category.
This type of ad hoc or goal-derived
category gave contestants trouble on
the Pyramid game show.

A final psychological principle for cre­
ating categories is organizing things
in ways that fit a theory or story that
makes a particular categorization
sensible. A theory-based category can

zation, on the basis of family resem­
blance or similarity with respect to
visible properties, would lead to a different category assignment. For example, a
theory of phase change explains why liquid water, ice, and steam are all the
same chemical compound even though they share few visible properties.
Theory-based categories based on origin or causation are especially important
with highly inventive and computational resources because unlike natural kinds
of physical resources, little or none of what they can do or how they behave is
visible on the surface (see §3.4.1 Affordance and Capability (page 123)). Consid­
er all of the different appearances and form factors of the resources that we cat­
egorize as “computers” —their essence is that they all compute, an invisible or
theory-like principle that does not depend on their visible properties.430[CogSci]

7.4 Category Design Issues and Implications
We have previously discussed the most important principles for creating catego­
ries: resource properties, similarity, and goals. When we use one or more of
these principles to develop a system of categories, we must make decisions
about its depth and breadth. Here, we examine the idea that some levels of ab­
straction in a system of categories are more basic or natural than others. We al­
so consider how the choices we make affect how we create the organizing sys­
tem in the first place, and how they shape our interactions when we need to find
some resources that are categorized in it.

7.4.1 Category Abstraction and Granularity
We can identify any resource as a unique instance or as a member of a class of
resources. The size of this class—the number of resources that are treated as
equivalent—is determined by the properties or characteristics we consider
when we examine the resources in some domain. The way we think of a re­
source domain depends on context and intent, so the same resource can be
thought of abstractly in some situations and very concretely in others. As we
discussed in Chapter 5, Resource Description and Metadata, this influences the
nature and extent of resource description, and as we have seen in this chapter,
it then influences the nature and extent of categories we can create.
Consider the regular chore of putting away clean clothes. We can consider any
item of clothing as a member of a broad category whose members are any kind
of garment that a person might wear. Using one category for all clothing, that
is, failing to distinguish among the various items in any useful or practical way
would likely mean that we would keep our clothes in a big unorganized pile.
However, we cannot wear any random combination of clothing items—we need
a shirt, a pair of pants, socks, and so on. Clearly, our indiscriminate clothing cat­
egory is too broad for most purposes. So instead, most people organize their
clothes in more fine-grained categories that fit the normal pattern of how they
wear clothes.
This tendency to use specific categories instead of broader ones is a general
principle that reflects how people organize their experience when they see simi­
lar, but not identical, examples or events. This “size principle” for concept learn­
ing, as cognitive scientist Josh Tenenbaum describes it, is a preference for the
most specific rules or descriptions that fit the observations. For example, if you
visit a zoo and see many different species of animals, your conception of what
you saw is different than if you visited a kennel that only contained dogs. You
might say “I saw animals at the zoo,” but would be more likely to say “I saw
dogs at the kennel” because using the broad “animal” category to describe your

356

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

Informatics Edition

kennel visit conveys less of what you learned from your observations
there.431[CogSci]
In §7.3.2 Single Properties (page 338) we described an organizing system for the
shirts in our closet, so let us talk about socks instead. When it comes to socks,
most people think that the basic unit is a pair because they always wear two
socks at a time. If you are going to need to find socks in pairs, it seems sensible
to organize them into pairs when you are putting them away. Some people
might further separate their dress socks from athletic ones, and then sort these
socks by color or material, creating a hierarchy of sock categories analogous to
the shirt categories in our previous example.
Questions of resource abstraction and granularity also emerge whenever the in­
formation systems of different firms, or different parts of a firm, need to ex­
change information or be merged into a single system. All parties must define
the identity of each thing in the same way, or in ways that can be related or
mapped to each other either manually or electronically.
For example, how should a business system deal with a customer’s address?
Printed on an envelope, “an address” typically appears as a comprehensive,
multi-line text object. Inside an information system, however, an address is best
stored as a set of distinctly identifiable information components. This finegrained organization makes it easier to sort customers by city or postal codes,
for sales and marketing purposes. Incompatibilities in the abstraction and gran­
ularity of these information components, and the ways in which they are presen­
ted and reused in documents, will cause interoperability problems when busi­
nesses need to share information.432[Com]
The Universal Business Language (UBL) (mentioned briefly in §8.1.5.2) is a li­
brary of information components designed to enable the creation of business
document models that span a range of category abstraction. UBL comes equip­
ped with XML schemas that define document categories like orders, invoices,
payments, and receipts that many people are familiar with from their personal
experiences of shopping and paying bills. However, UBL can also be used to de­
sign very specific or subordinate level transactional document types like “pur­
chase order for industrial chemicals when buyer and seller are in different coun­
tries,” or document types at the other end of the abstraction hierarchy like “fillin-the-blank” legal forms for any kind of contract.
It might seem counterintuitive, but when a system of human-generated catego­
ries is too complex for people to interpret and apply reliably, computational clas­
sifiers that compute statistical similarity between new and already classified
items can outperform people.434[DS]

7.4 Category Design Issues and Implications

The Discipline of Organizing

7.4.2 Basic or Natural Categories
Category abstraction is normally described in terms of a hierarchy of superordi­
nate, basic, and subordinate category levels. “Clothing,” for example, is a super­
ordinate category, “shirts” and “socks” are basic categories, and “white longsleeve dress shirts” and “white wool hiking socks” are subordinate categories.
Members of basic level categories like “shirts” and “socks” have many perceptu­
al properties in common, and are more strongly associated with motor move­
ments than members of superordinate categories. Members of subordinate cate­
gories have many common properties, but these properties are also shared by
members of other subordinate categories at the same level of abstraction in the
category hierarchy. That is, while we can identify many properties shared by all
“white long-sleeve dress shirts,” many of them are also properties of “blue longsleeve dress shirts” and “black long-sleeve pullover shirts.”
Psychological research suggests that some levels of abstraction in a system of
categories are more basic or natural than others. Anthropologists have also ob­
served that folk taxonomies invariably classify natural phenomena into a five- or
six-level hierarchy, with one of the levels being the psychologically basic or “re­
al” name (such as “cat” or “dog”), as opposed to more abstract names (e.g.
“mammal”) that are used less in everyday life. An implication for organizing sys­
tem design is that basic level categories are highly efficient in terms of the cog­
nitive effort they take to create and use. A corollary is that classifications with
many levels at different abstraction levels may be difficult for users to navigate
effectively.435[CogSci]

7.4.3 The Recall / Precision Tradeoff
The abstraction level we choose determines how precisely we identify resour­
ces. When we want to make a general claim, or communicate that the scope of
our interest is broad, we use superordinate categories, as when we ask, “How
many animals are in the San Diego Zoo?” But we use precise subordinate cate­
gories when we need to be specific: “How many adult emus are in the San Diego

If we return to our clothing example, finding a pair of white wool hiking socks is
very easy if the organizing system for socks creates fine-grained categories.
When resources are described or arranged with this level of detail, a similarly
detailed specification of the resources you are looking for yields precisely what
you want. When you get to the place where you keep white wool hiking socks,
you find all of them and nothing else. On the other hand, if all your socks are
tossed unsorted into a sock drawer, when you go sock hunting you might not be
able to find the socks you want and you will encounter lots of socks you do not
want. But you will not have put time into sorting them, which many people do

not enjoy doing; you can spend time sorting or searching depending on your
preferences.
If we translate this example into the jargon of information retrieval, we say that
more fine-grained organization reduces recall, the number of resources you find
or retrieve in response to a query, but increases the precision of the recalled
set, the proportion of recalled items that are relevant. Broader or coarsegrained categories increase recall, but lower precision. We are all too familiar
with this hard bargain when we use a web search engine; a quick one-word
query results in many pages of mostly irrelevant sites, whereas a carefully craf­
ted multi-word query pinpoints sites with the information we seek. We will dis­
cuss recall, precision, and evaluation of information retrieval more extensively
in Chapter 10, Interactions with Resources.
This mundane example illustrates the fundamental tradeoff between organiza­
tion and retrieval. A tradeoff between the investment in organization and the in­
vestment in retrieval persists in nearly every organizing system. The more effort
we put into organizing resources, the more effectively they can be retrieved.
The more effort we are willing to put into retrieving resources, the less they
need to be organized first. The allocation of costs and benefits between the or­
ganizer and retriever differs according to the relationship between them. Are
they the same person? Who does the work and who gets the benefit?

7.4.4 Category Audience and Purpose
The ways in which people categorize depend on the goals of categorization, the
breadth of the resources in the collection to be categorized, and the users of the
organizing system. Suppose that we want to categorize languages. Our first step
might be determining what constitutes a language, since there is no widespread
agreement on what differentiates a language from a dialect, or even on whether
such a distinction exists.
What we mean by “English” and “Chinese” as categories can change depending
on the audience we are addressing and what our purpose is, however.436[Ling] A
language learning school’s representation of “English” might depend on practi­
cal concerns such as how the school’s students are likely to use the language
they learn, or which teachers are available. For the purposes of a school teach­
ing global languages, and one of the standard varieties of English (i.e., those as­
sociated with political power), or an amalgamation of several standard varieties,
might be thought of as a single instance (“English”) of the category “Languag­
es.”
Similarly, the category structure in which “Chinese” is situated can vary with
context. While some schools might not conceptualize “Chinese” as a category
encompassing multiple linguistic varieties, but rather as a single instance within
the “Languages” category, another school might teach its students Mandarin,

Wu, and Cantonese as dialects within the language category “Chinese,” that are
unified by a single standard writing system. In addition, a linguist might consid­
er Mandarin, Wu, and Cantonese to be mutually unintelligible, making them
separate languages within the broader category “Chinese” for the purpose of
creating a principled language classification system.
If people could only categorize in a single way, the Pyramid game show, where
contestants guess what category is illustrated by the example provided by a
clue giver, would pose no challenge. The creative possibilities provided by cate­
gorization allow people to order the world and refer to interrelationships among
conceptions through a kind of allusive shorthand. When we talk about the lan­
guage of fashion, we suggest that in the context of our conversation, instances
like “English,” “Chinese,” and “fashion” are alike in ways that distinguish them
from other things that we would not categorize as languages.

7.5 Implementing Categories
Categories are conceptual constructs that we use in a mostly invisible way when
we talk or think about them. When we organize our kitchens, closets, or file cab­
inets using shelves, drawers, and folders, these physical locations and contain­
ers are visible implementations of our personal category system, but they are
not the categories. This distinction between category design and implementa­
tion is obvious when we follow signs and labels in libraries or grocery stores to
find things, search a product catalog or company personnel directory, or analyze
a set of economic data assembled by the government from income tax forms.
These institutional categories were designed by people prior to the assignment
of resources to them.
This separation between category creation and category implementation
prompts us to ask how a system of categories can be implemented. We will not
discuss the implementation of categories in the literal sense of building physical
or software systems that organize resources. Instead, we will take a higher-level
perspective that analyzes the implementation problem to be solved for the dif­
ferent types of categories discussed in §7.3, and then explain the logic followed
to assign resources correctly to them.

7.5.1 Implementing Enumerated Categories
Categories defined by enumeration are easy to implement. The members or le­
gal values in a set define the category, and testing an item for membership
means looking in the set for it. Enumerated category definitions are familiar in
drop-down menus and form-filling. You scroll through a list of all the countries
in the world to search for the one you want in a shipping address, and whatever
you select will be a valid country name, because the list is fixed until a new
country is born. Enumerated categories can also be implemented with associa­
tive arrays (also known as hash tables or dictionaries). With these data struc­
tures, a test for set membership is even more efficient than searching, because
it takes the same time for sets of any size (see §9.2.1 Kinds of Structures (page
442)).

7.5.2 Implementing Categories Defined by Properties
The most conceptually simple and straightforward implementation of categories
defined by properties adopts the classical view of categories based on necessary
and sufficient features. Because such categories are prescriptive with explicit
and clear boundaries, classifying items into the categories is objective and de­
terministic, and supports a well-defined notion of validation to determine unam­
biguously whether some instance is a member of the category. Items are classi­
fied by testing them to determine if they have the required properties and prop­
erty values. Tests can be expressed as rules:
• If instance X has property P, then X is in category Y.
• If a home mortgage loan in San Francisco exceeds $625,000, then it is clas­
sified as a “jumbo” loan by the US Office of Federal Housing Oversight.
• For a number to be classified as prime it must satisfy two rules: It must be
greater than 1, and have no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
This doesn’t mean the property test is always easy; validation might require
special equipment or calculations, and tests for the property might differ in
their cost or efficiency. But given the test results, the answer is unambiguous.
The item is either a member of the category or it isn’t.437[Com]
A system of hierarchical categories is defined by a sequence of property tests in
a particular order. The most natural way to implement multi-level category sys­
tems is with decision trees. A simple decision tree is an algorithm for determin­
ing a decision by making a sequence of logical or property tests. Suppose a
bank used a sequential rule-based approach to decide whether to give someone
a mortgage loan.

7.5 Implementing Categories

361

• If applicant’s annual income exceeds $100,000, and if the monthly loan pay­
ment is less than 25% of monthly income, approve the mortgage application.
• Otherwise, deny the loan application.
This simple decision tree is depicted in Figure 7.1, Rule-based Decision Tree. The
rules used by the bank to classify loan applications as “Approved” or “Denied”
have a clear representation in the tree. The easy interpretation of decision trees
makes them a common formalism for implementing classification models.

Figure 7.1. Rule-based Decision Tree

In this simple decision tree, a sequence of two tests for the borrower's annual
income and the percentage of monthly income required to make the loan pay­
ment classify the applicants into the “deny” and “approve” categories.

Nevertheless, any implementation of a category is only interpretable to the ex­
tent that the properties and tests it uses in its definition and implementation
can be understood. Because natural language is inherently ambiguous, it is not
the optimal representational format for formally defined institutional categories.
Categories defined using natural language can be incomplete, inconsistent, or

362

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

Informatics Edition

ambiguous because words often have multiple meanings. This implementation
of the bank’s procedure for evaluating loans would be hard to interpret reliably:
• If applicant is wealthy, and then if the monthly payment is an amount that
the applicant can easily repay, then applicant is approved.
To ensure their interpretability, decision trees are sometimes specified using the
controlled vocabularies and constrained syntax of “simplified writing” or “busi­
ness rule” systems.
Artificial languages are a more ambitious way to enable precise specification of
property-based categories. An artificial language expresses ideas concisely by
introducing new terms or symbols that represent complex ideas along with syn­
tactic mechanisms for combining and operating on them. Mathematical nota­
tion, programming languages, schema languages that define valid document in­
stances (see §9.2.3.1), and regular expressions that define search and selection
patterns (see §9.2.3.2) are familiar examples of artificial languages. It is certain­
ly easier to explain and understand the Pythagorean Theorem when it is effi­
ciently expressed as “H2 = A2 + B2” than with a more verbose natural language
expression: “In all triangles with an angle such that the sides forming the angle
are perpendicular, the product of the length of the side opposite the angle such
that the sides forming the angle are perpendicular with itself is equal to the
sum of the products of the lengths of the other two sides, each with it­
self.”438[CogSci]
Artificial languages for defining categories have a long history in philosophy and
science. (See the sidebar, Artificial Languages for Description and Classification
(page 364)). However, the vast majority of institutional category systems are
still specified with natural language, despite its ambiguities because people usu­
ally understand the languages they learned naturally better than artificial ones.
Sometimes this is even intentional to allow institutional categories embodied in
laws to evolve in the courts and to accommodate technological advances.439[Law]
Data schemas that specify data entities, elements, identifiers, attributes, and re­
lationships in databases and XML document types on the transactional end of
the Document Type Spectrum (§4.2.1) are implementations of the categories
needed for the design, development and maintenance of information organiza­
tion systems. Data schemas tend to rigidly define categories of resources. 441[Com]
In object-oriented programming languages, classes are schemas that serve as
templates for the creation of objects. A class in a programming language is
analogous to a database schema that specifies the structure of its member in­
stances, in that the class definition specifies how instances of the class are con­
structed in terms of data types and possible values. Programming classes may
also specify whether data in a member object can be accessed, and if so,
how.442[Com]

Artificial Languages for Description and Classification
John Wilkins was one of the founders of the British Royal Society. In 1668
he published An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Lan­
guage in which he proposed an artificial language for describing a universal
taxonomy of knowledge that used symbol composition to specify a location
in the category hierarchy. There were forty top level genus categories,
which were further subdivided into differences within the genus, which
were then subdivided into species. Each genus was a monosyllable of two
letters; each difference added a consonant, and each species added a vowel.
This artificial language conveys the meaning of categories directly from the
composition of the category name. For instance, zi indicates the genus of
beasts, zit would be “rapacious beasts of the dog kind” whereas zid would
be “cloven-footed beast.” Adding for the fourth character an a for species,
indicating the second species in the difference, would give zita for dog and
zida for sheep.
In The Analytical Language of John Wilkins, Jorge Luis Borges remarks that
Wilkins has many “ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies” in the lan­
guage and presents as a foil and parody an imagined “Celestial Empire of
Benevolent Knowledge.”
In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: (a) belong­
ing to the emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f)
fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) fren­
zied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camel hair brush, (l) et ce­
tera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off
look like flies.

Borges compliments Wilkins for inventing names that might signify in them­
selves some meaning to those who know the system, but notes that “it is
clear that there is no classification of the Universe not being arbitrary and
full of conjectures.”440[Ling]
Unlike transactional document types, which can be prescriptively defined as
classical categories because they are often produced and consumed by automa­
ted processes, narrative document types are usually descriptive in character.
We do not classify something as a novel because it has some specific set of prop­
erties and content types. Instead, we have a notion of typical novels and their
characteristic properties, and some things that are considered novels are far
from typical in their structure and content.443[CogSci]
Nevertheless, categories like narrative document types can sometimes be imple­
mented using document schemas that impose only a few constraints on struc­
ture and content. A schema for a purchase order is highly prescriptive; it uses
364

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

Informatics Edition

regular expressions, strongly data typed content, and enumerated code lists to
validate the value of required elements that must occur in a particular order. In
contrast, a schema for a narrative document type would have much optionality,
be flexible about order, and expect only text in its sections, paragraphs and
headings. Even very lax document schemas can be useful in making content
management, reuse, and formatting more efficient.

7.5.3 Implementing Categories Defined by Probability and Similarity
Many categories cannot be defined in terms of required properties, and instead
must be defined probabilistically, where category membership is determined by
properties that resources are likely to share. Consider the category “friend.”
You probably consider many people to be your friends, but you have longtime
friends, school friends, workplace friends, friends you see only at the gym, and
friends of your parents. Each of these types of friends represents a different
cluster of common properties. If someone is described to you as a potential
friend or date, how accurately can you predict that the person will become a
friend? (See the sidebar, Finding Friends and Dates: Lessons for Learning Catego­
ries (page 366))
Probabilistic categories can be challenging to define and use because it can be
difficult to keep in mind the complex feature correlations and probabilities ex­
hibited by different clusters of instances from some domain. Furthermore, when
the category being learned is broad with a large number of members, the sam­
ple from which you learn strongly shapes what you learn. For example, people
who grow up in high-density and diverse urban areas may have less predictable
ideas of what an acceptable potential date looks like than someone in a remote
rural area with a more homogeneous population.
More generally, if you are organizing a domain where the resources are active,
change their state, or are measurements of properties that vary and co-occur
probabilistically, the sample you choose strongly affects the accuracy of models
for classification or prediction. In The Signal and the Noise, statistician Nate
Silver explains how many notable predictions failed because of poor sampling
techniques. One common sampling mistake is to use too short a historical win­
dow to assemble the training dataset; this is often a corollary of a second mis­
take, an over reliance on recent data because it is more available. For example,
the collapse of housing prices and the resulting financial crisis of 2008 can be
explained in part because the models that lenders used to predict mortgage
foreclosures were based on data from 1980-2005, when house prices tended to
grow higher. As a result, when mortgage foreclosures increased rapidly, the re­
sults were “out of sample” and were initially misinterpreted, delaying responses
to the crisis.

Finding Friends and Dates: Lessons for Learning Categories
Online dating or matchmaking sites use many of the same features to de­
scribe people, but also have additional features to make more accurate
matches for their targeted users. As the number of features grows, there
are exponentially more combinations of shared properties. For example, the
matchmaking site eHarmony employs 29 “Dimensions of Compatibility” and
more than 200 questions to create a user profile. Even if the 29 dimensions
were Boolean (would you describe yourself as x?) this yields 229 or over
500,000,000 different combinations. Using these complex resource descrip­
tions to predict the probability of a good match requires matchmaking sites
to use proprietary machine learning algorithms to propose matches, which
are ranked with unexplained measures and precision (what does an 80%
match mean?). Not surprisingly, many people who try online dating give up
after less success than they expected.
With such a large number of features in user profiles, any matching algo­
rithm confronts what machine learning calls the curse of dimensionality.
With high-dimensional data, there can never be enough instances to learn
which features are really the most important. Neither you nor the online
dating algorithm will ever meet enough different kinds of people to reliably
predict the outcome of a possible match.
But all is not hopeless. Machine learning programs attack the curse of di­
mensionality using statistical techniques that use correlations among fea­
tures to combine them or adjust the weights given to features to reflect
their value in making predictions or classifications. For example, OKCupid
asks people to rate how much importance they assign to match questions.
You might prefer cats to dogs, and you might either never consider dating a
dog lover or you might not care at all.
Another way to reduce the number of features needed to classify accurately
is to reduce the scope of the category being learned. The matchmaking
model for sites that target people with particular professions, religions, or
political views would be less complex than the eHarmony one, because the
former will have fewer relevant features, and hence fewer random correla­
tions and noise that will undermine its accuracy. All other things being
equal, the lower the variability in a set of examples, the better a model that
learns from that data will perform.
Samples from dynamic and probabilistic domains result in models that capture
this variability. Unfortunately, because many forecasters want to seem authori­
tative, and many people do not understand probability, classifications or predic­
tions that are inherently imprecise are often presented with certainty and exact­
ness even though they are probabilistic with a range of outcomes. Silver tells

the story of a disastrous 1997 flood caused when the Red River crested at 54
feet when the levees protecting the town of Grand Forks were at 51 feet. The
weather service had predicted a crest between 40 and 58 feet, but emphasized
the midpoint of the range, which was 49 feet. Unfortunately, most people inter­
preted this probabilistic prediction as if it were a binary classification, “flood”
versus “no flood,” ignored the range of the forecast, and failed to prepare for a
flood that had about a 35% chance of occurring.444[DS]

7.5.3.1 Probabilistic Decision Trees
In §7.5.2, we showed how a rule-based decision tree could be used to implement
a strict property-based classification in which a bank uses tests for the proper­
ties of “annual income” and “monthly loan payment” to classify applicants as ap­
proved or denied. We can adapt that example to illustrate probabilistic decision
trees, which are better suited for implementing categories in which category
membership is probabilistic rather than absolute.
Banks that are more flexible about making loans can be more profitable because
they can make loans to people that a stricter bank would reject but who still are
able to make loan payments. Instead of enforcing conservative and fixed cutoffs
on income and monthly payments, these banks consider more properties and
look at applications in a more probabilistic way. These banks recognize that not
every loan applicant who is likely to repay the loan looks exactly the same; “an­
nual income” and “monthly loan payment” remain important properties, but oth­
er factors might also be useful predictors, and there is more than one configura­
tion of values that an applicant could satisfy to be approved for a loan.
Which properties of applicants best predict whether they will repay the loan or
default? A property that predicts each at 50% isn’t helpful because the bank
might as well flip a coin, but a property that splits the applicants into two sets,
each with very different probabilities for repayment and defaulting, is very help­
ful in making a loan decision.
A data-driven bank relies upon historical data about loan repayment and de­
faults to train algorithms that create decision trees by repeatedly splitting the
applicants into subsets that are most different in their predictions. Subsets of
applicants with a high probability of repayment would be approved, and those
with a high probability of default would be denied a loan. One method for select­
ing the property test for making each split is calculating the “information gain”
(see the sidebar Using “Information Theory” to Quantify Organization (page 75)).
This measure captures the degree to which each subset contains a “pure” group
in which every applicant is classified the same, as likely repayers or likely de­
faulters.
For example, consider the chart in Figure 7.2, Historical Data: Loan Repayment
Based on Interest Rate which is a simplified representation of the bank’s histori­
7.5 Implementing Categories

cal data on loan defaults based on the initial interest rate. The chart represents
loans that were repaid with “o” and those that defaulted with “x.” Is there an in­
terest rate that divides them into “pure” sets, one that contains only “o” loans
and the other that contains only “x” loans?

Figure 7.2. Historical Data: Loan Repayment Based on Interest Rate

The “o” symbol represents loans that were repaid by the borrower; “x” repre­
sents loans on which the borrower defaulted. A 6% rate (darker vertical line)
best divides the loans into subsets that differ in the payment outcome.

You can see that no interest rate divides these into pure sets. So the best that
can be done is to find the interest rate that divides them so that the proportions
of defaulters are most different on each side of the line.445[DS]
This dividing line at the 6% interest rate best divides those who defaulted from
those who repaid their loan. Most people who borrowed at 6% or greater repaid
the loan, while those who took out loans at a lower rate were more likely to de­
fault. This might seem counter-intuitive until you learn that the lower-interest
rate loans had adjustable rates that increased after a few years, causing the
monthly payments to increase substantially. More prudent borrowers were will­

368

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

ing to pay higher interest rates that were fixed rather than adjustable to avoid
radical increases in their monthly payments.

Figure 7.3. Probabilistic Decision Tree

In this probabilistic decision tree, the sequence of property tests and the thresh­
old values in each test divide the loan applicants into categories that differ in
how likely they are to repay the loan.

This calculation is carried out for each of the attributes in the historical data set
to identify the one that best divides the applicants into the repaid and defaulted
categories. The attributes and the value that defines the decision rule can then
be ordered to create a decision tree similar to the rule-based one we saw in
§7.5.2. In our hypothetical case, it turns out that the best order in which to test
the properties is Income, Monthly Payment, and Interest Rate, as shown in Fig­
ure 7.3, Probabilistic Decision Tree. The end result is still a set of rules, but be­
hind each decision in the tree are probabilities based on historical data that can
more accurately predict whether an applicant will repay or default. Thus, in­
7.5 Implementing Categories

369

The Discipline of Organizing

stead of the arbitrary cutoffs at $100,000 in income and 25% for monthly pay­
ment, the bank can offer loans to people with lower incomes and remain profita­
ble doing so, because it knows from historical data that $82,000 and 27% are
the optimal decision points. Using the interest rate in their decision process is
an additional test to ensure that people can afford to make loan payments even
if interest rates go up.446[Bus]
Because decision trees specify a sequence of rules that make property tests,
they are highly interpretable, which makes them a very popular choice for data
scientists building models much more complex than the simple loan example
here. But they assume that every class is a conjunction of all the properties
used to define them. This makes them susceptible to over-fitting because if they
grow very deep with many property conjunctions, they capture exactly the prop­
erties that describe each member of the training set, effectively memorizing the
training data. In other words, they capture both what is generally true beyond
the set and what is particular to the training set only, when the goal is to build a
model that captures only what is generally true. Overfitting in decision trees
can be prevented by pruning back the tree after it has perfectly classified the
training set, or by limiting the depth of the tree in advance, essentially prepruning it.

7.5.3.2 Naïve Bayes Classifiers
Another commonly used approach to implement a classifier for probabilistic cat­
egories is called Naïve Bayes. It employs Bayes’ Theorem for learning the im­
portance of a particular property for correct classification. There are some com­
mon sense ideas that are embodied in Bayes’ Theorem:
• When you have a hypothesis or prior belief about the relationship between a
property and a classification, new evidence consistent with that belief should
increase your confidence.
• Contradictory evidence should reduce confidence in your belief.
• If the base rate for some kind of event is low, do not forget that when you
make a prediction or classification for a new specific instance. It is easy to
be overly influenced by recent information.
Now we can translate these ideas into calculations about how learning takes
place. For property A and classification B, Bayes’ Theorem says:
P (A | B) = P (B|A) P(A) / P(B)
The left hand side of the equation, P (A | B), is what we want to estimate but
can’t measure directly: the probability that A is the correct classification for an
item or observation that has property B. This is called the conditional or posteri­
or probability because it is estimated after seeing the evidence of property B.
370

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

Informatics Edition

P (B | A) is the probability that any item correctly classified as A has property B.
This is called the likelihood function.
P (A) and P (B) are the independent or prior probabilities of A and B; what pro­
portion of the items are classified as A? How often does property B occur in
some set of items?

Using Bayes’ Theorem to Calculate Conditional Probability
Your personal library contains 60% fiction and 40% nonfiction books. All of
the fiction books are in ebook format, and half of the nonfiction books are
ebooks and half are in print format. If you pick a book at random and it is in
ebook format, what is the probability that it is nonfiction?
Bayes’ Theorem tells us that:
P (nonfiction | ebook) = P (ebook |nonfiction) x P (nonfiction) / P (ebook).
We know: P (ebook | nonfiction) = .5 and P (nonfiction) = .4
We compute P (ebook) using the law of total probability to compute the
combined probability of all the independent ways in which an ebook might
be sampled. In this example there are two ways:
P (ebook) = P (ebook | nonfiction) x P (nonfiction)
+ P (ebook | fiction) x P (fiction)
= (.5 x .4) + (1 x .6) = .8
Therefore: P (nonfiction | ebook) = (.5 x .4) / .8 = .25
Now let’s apply Bayes’ Theorem to implement email spam filtering. Messages
are classified as SPAM or HAM (i.e., non-SPAM); the former are sent to a SPAM
folder, while the latter head to your inbox.
1. Select Properties. We start with a set of properties, some from the message
metadata like the sender’s email address or the number of recipients, and
some from the message content. Every word that appears in messages can
be treated as a separate property447[Com]
2. Assemble Training Data. We assemble a set of email message that have been
correctly assigned to the SPAM and HAM categories. These labeled instan­
ces make up the training set.
3. Analyze the Training Data. For each message, does it contain a particular
property? For each message, is it classified as SPAM? If a message is classi­
fied as SPAM, does it contain a particular property? (These are the three
probabilities on the right side of the Bayes equation).

7.5 Implementing Categories

371

4. Learn. The conditional probability (the left side of the Bayes equation) is re­
calculated, adjusting the predictive value of each property. Taken together,
all of the properties are now able to correctly assign (most of) the messages
into the categories they belonged to in the training set.
5. Classify. The trained classifier is now ready to classify uncategorized mes­
sages to the SPAM or HAM categories.
6. Improve. The classifier can improve its accuracy if the user gives it feedback
by reclassifying SPAM messages as HAM ones or vice versa. The most effi­
cient learning occurs when an algorithm uses “active learning” techniques
to choose its own training data by soliciting user feedback only where it is
uncertain about how to classify a message. For example, the algorithm
might be confident that a message with “Cheap drugs” in the subject line is
SPAM, but if the message comes from a longtime correspondent, the algo­
rithm might ask the user to confirm that the classification.448[Com]

7.5.3.3 Categories Created by Clustering
In the previous two sections we discussed how probabilistic decision trees and
naïve Bayes classifiers implement categories that are defined by typically
shared properties and similarity. Both are examples of supervised learning be­
cause they need correctly classified examples as training data, and they learn
the categories they are taught.
In contrast, clustering techniques are unsupervised; they analyze a collection of
uncategorized resources to discover statistical regularities or structure among
the items, creating a set of categories without any labeled training data.
Clustering techniques share the goal of creating meaningful categories from a
collection of items whose properties are hard to directly perceive and evaluate,
which implies that category membership cannot easily be reduced to specific
property tests and instead must be based on similarity. For example, with large
sets of documents or behavioral data, clustering techniques can find categories
of documents with the same topics, genre, or sentiment, or categories of people
with similar habits and preferences.
Because clustering techniques are unsupervised, they create categories based
on calculations of similarity between resources, maximizing the similarity of re­
sources within a category and maximizing the differences between them. These
statistically-learned categories are not always meaningful ones that can be
named and used by people, and the choice of properties and methods for calcu­
lating similarity can result in very different numbers and types of categories.
Some clustering techniques for text resources suggest names for the clusters
based on the important words in documents at the center of each cluster. How­
ever, unless there is a labeled set of resources from the same domain that can
372

Chapter 7 — Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types

Informatics Edition

be used as a check to see if the clustering discovered the same categories, it is
up to the data analyst or information scientist to make sense of the discovered
clusters or topics.
There are many different distance-based clustering techniques, but they share
three basic methods.
• The first shared method is that clustering techniques start with an initially
uncategorized set of items or documents that are represented in ways that
enable measures of inter-item similarity can be calculated. This representa­
tion is most often a vector of property values or the probabilities of different
properties, so that items can be represented in a multidimensional space
and similarity calculated using a distance function like those described in
§7.3.6.2 Geometric Models of Similarity (page 352).449[Com]
• The second shared method is that categories are created by putting items
that are most similar into the same category. Hierarchical clustering ap­
proaches start with every item in its own category. Other approaches, nota­
bly one called “K-means clustering,” start with a fixed number of K catego­
ries initialized with a randomly chosen item or document from the complete
set.
• The third shared method is refining the system of categories by iterative
similarity recalculation each time an item is added to a category. Approaches
that start with every item in its own category create a hierarchical system of
categories by merging the two most similar categories, recomputing the sim­
ilarity between the new category and the remaining ones, and repeating this
process until all the categories are merged into a single category at the root
of a category tree. Techniques that start with a fixed number of categories
do not create new ones but instead repeatedly recalculate the “centroid” of
the category by adjusting its property representation to the average of all its
members after a new member is added.450[Com]
It makes sense that the algorithms that create clusters or categories of similar
items can be later used as classifiers by using the same similarity measures to
compare the unclassified items against items that are labeled by category. There
are different choices about which items to compare with the unclassified one:
• The centroid: a prototypical or average item calculated on the properties of
all the category members. However, the centroid might not correspond to
any actual member (see the sidebar Median versus Average (page 117)), and
this can make it hard to interpret the classification.
• Items that actually exist: Because the items in categories defined by similari­
ty are not equally typical or good members, it is more robust to test against
more than one exemplar. Classifiers that use this approach are called

7.5 Implementing Categories

373

The Discipline of Organizing

nearest-neighbor techniques, and they essentially vote among themselves
and the majority category is assigned to the new item.
• The edge cases: These are instances that are closest to the boundary be­
tween two categories, so there need to be at least two of them, one in each
category. Because they are not typical members of the category, they are the
hardest to classify initially, but using them in classifiers emphasizes the
properties that are the most discriminating. This is the approach taken by
support vector machines, which are not clustering algorithms but are some­
what like nearest-neighbor algorithms in that they calculate the similarity of
an unclassified item to these edge cases. Their name makes more sense if
you think of the vectors that represent the “edge cases” being used to “sup­
port” the category boundary, which falls between them.

7.5.3.4 Neural networks
Among the best performing classifiers for categorizing by similarity and proba­
bilistic membership are those implemented using neural networks, and especial­
ly those employing deep learning techniques. Deep learning algorithms can
learn categories from labeled training data or by using autoencoding, an unsu­
pervised learning technique that trains a neural network to reconstruct its input
data. However, instead of using the properties that are defined in the data, deep
learning algorithms devise a very large number of features in hidden hierarchi­
cal layers, which makes them uninterpretable by people. The key idea that
made deep learning possible is the use of “backpropagation” to adjust the
weights on features by working backwards from the output (the object classifi­
cation produced by the network) all the way back to the input. The use of deep
learning to classify images was mentioned in §5.4.2.451[DS]

7.5.4 Implementing Goal-Based Categories
Goal-based categories are highly individualized, and are often used just once in
a very specific context. However, it is useful to consider that we could imple­
ment model goal-derived categories as rule-based decision trees by ordering the
decisions to ensure that any sub-goals are satisfied according to their priority.
We could understand the category “Things to take from a burning house” by
first asking the question “Are there living things in the house?” because that
might be the most important sub-goal. If the answer to that question is “yes,”
we might proceed along a different path than if the answer is “no.” Similarly, we
might put a higher priority on things that cannot be replaced (Grandma’s pho­
tos) than those that can (passport).

7.5.5 Implementing Theory-Based Categories
Theory-based categories arise in domains in which the items to be categorized
are characterized by abstract or complex relationships with their features and
with each other. With this model an entity need not be understood as inherently
possessing features shared in common with another entity. Rather, people
project features from one thing to another in a search for congruities between
things, much as clue receivers in the second round of the Pyramid game search
for congruities between examples provided by the clue giver in order to guess
the target category. For example, a clue like “screaming baby” can suggest
many categories, as can “parking meter.” But the likely intersection of the inter­
actions one can have with babies and parking meters is that they are both
“Things you need to feed.”
Theory-based categories are created as cognitive constructs when we use analo­
gies and classify, because things brought together by analogy have abstract
rather than literal similarity. The most influential model of analogical processing
is Structure Mapping, whose development and application has been guided by
Dedre Gentner for over three decades.
The key insight in Structure Mapping is that an analogy “a T is like B” is cre­
ated by matching relational structures and not properties between the base do­
main B and a target domain T. We take any two things, analyze the relational
structures they contain, and align them to find correspondences between them.
The properties of objects in the two domains need not match, and in fact, if too
many properties match, analogy goes away and we have literal similarity:
• Analogy: The hydrogen atom is like our solar system
• Literal Similarity: The X12 star system in the Andromeda galaxy is like our
solar system
Structure Mapping theory was implemented in the Structure-Mapping Engine
(SME), which both formalized the theory and offered a computationallytractable algorithm for carrying out the process of mapping structures and
drawing inferences.452[CogSci]

• Categories are equivalence classes: sets or groups of things or abstract enti­
ties that we treat the same.
(See §7.2 The What and Why of Categories (page 325))
• The size of the equivalence class is determined by the properties or charac­
teristics we consider.
(See §7.2 The What and Why of Categories (page 325))
• Cultural, individual, and institutional categorization share some core ideas
but they emphasize different processes and purposes for creating catego­
ries.
(See §7.2 The What and Why of Categories (page 325))
• Individual categories are created by intentional activity that usually takes
place in response to a specific situation.
(See §7.2.2 Individual Categories (page 330))
• Institutional categories are most often created in abstract and informationintensive domains where unambiguous and precise categories are needed.
(See §7.2.3 Institutional Categories (page 331))
• The rigorous definition of institutional categories enables classification, the
systematic assignment of resources to categories in an organizing system.
(See §7.2.3 Institutional Categories (page 331))
• Computational categories are created by computer programs when the num­
ber of resources, or when the number of descriptions or observations associ­
ated with each resource, are so large that people cannot think about them
effectively.
(See §7.2.5 Computational Categories (page 334))
• In supervised learning, a machine learning program is trained by giving it
sample items or documents that are labeled by category. In unsupervised
learning, the program gets the samples but has to come up with the catego­
ries on its own.
(See Supervised and Unsupervised Learning (page 336))
• Any collection of resources with sortable identifiers (alphabetic or numeric)
as an associated property can benefit from using sorting order as an organ­
izing principle.
(See §7.3.2 Single Properties (page 338))

• If only a single property is used to distinguish among some set of resources
and to create the categories in an organizing system, the choice of property
is critical because different properties often lead to different categories.
(See §7.3.2 Single Properties (page 338))
• A sequence of organizing decisions based on a fixed ordering of resource
properties creates a hierarchy, a multi-level category system.
(See §7.3.3.1 Multi-Level or Hierarchical Categories (page 340))
• An important implication of necessary and sufficient category definition is
that every member of the category is an equally good member or example of
the category.
(See §7.3.3.3 Necessary and Sufficient Properties (page 344))
• For most purposes, the most useful property of information resources for
categorizing them is their aboutness, which is not directly perceivable and
which is hard to characterize.
(See §7.3.4 The Limits of Property-Based Categorization (page 346))
• In domains where properties lack one or more of the characteristics of sepa­
rability, perceptibility, and necessity, a probabilistic or statistical view of
properties is needed to define categories.
(See §7.3.5 Probabilistic Categories and “Family Resemblance” (page 348))
• Sharing some but not all properties is akin to family resemblances among
the category members.
(See §7.3.5 Probabilistic Categories and “Family Resemblance” (page 348))
• Similarity is a measure of the resemblance between two things that share
some characteristics but are not identical.
(See §7.3.6 Similarity (page 351))
• Feature- or property-based, geometry-based, transformational, and
alignment- or analogy-based approaches are psychologically-motivated ap­
proaches that propose different functions for computing similarity.
(See §7.3.6 Similarity (page 351))
• Classical categories can be defined precisely with just a few necessary and
sufficient properties.
(See §7.4.2 Basic or Natural Categories (page 358))
• Broader or coarse-grained categories increase recall, but lower precision.
(See §7.4.3 The Recall / Precision Tradeoff (page 358))

a sequence of logical or property tests.

(See §7.5.2 Implementing Categories Defined by Properties (page 361))
• The most conceptually simple and straightforward implementation of cate­
gories in technologies for organizing systems adopts the classical view of
categories based on necessary and sufficient features.
(See §7.5.2 Implementing Categories Defined by Properties (page 361))
• An artificial language expresses ideas concisely by introducing new terms or
symbols that represent complex ideas along with syntactic mechanisms for
combining and operating on them.
(See §7.5.2 Implementing Categories Defined by Properties (page 361))
• Naïve Bayes classifiers learn by revising the conditional probability of each
property for making the correct classification after seeing the base rates of
the class and property in the training data and how likely it is that a member
of the class has the property.
(See §7.5.3.2 Naïve Bayes Classifiers (page 370))
• Because clustering techniques are unsupervised, they create categories
based on calculations of similarity between resources, maximizing the simi­

Endnotes for Chapter 7
Cataloging and programming are important activities that need to be
done well, and prescriptive advice is often essential. However, we believe that
understanding how people create psychological and linguistic categories can
help us appreciate that cataloging and information systems design are messier
and more intellectually challenging activities than we might otherwise think.
[386][CogSci]

Cognitive science mostly focuses on the automatic and unconscious
mechanisms for creating and using categories. This disciplinary perspective em­
phasizes the activation of category knowledge for the purpose of making infer­
ences and “going beyond the information given,” to use Bruner’s classic phrase
(Bruner 1957). In contrast, the discipline of organizing focuses on the explicit
and self-aware mechanisms for creating and using categories because by defini­
tion, organizing systems serve intentional and often highly explicit purposes.
Organizing systems facilitate inferences about the resources they contain, but
the more constrained purposes for which resources are described and arranged
makes inference a secondary goal.
[387][CogSci]

378

Informatics Edition

Cognitive science is also highly focused on understanding and creating compu­
tational models of the mechanisms for creating and using categories. These
models blend data-driven or bottom-up processing with knowledge-driven or
top-down processing to simulate the time course and results of categorization at
both fine-grained scales (as in word or object recognition) and over developmen­
tal time frames (as in how children learn categories). The discipline of organiz­
ing can learn from these models about the types of properties and principles
that organizing systems use, but these computational models are not a primary
concern to us in this book.
However, even the way this debate has been framed is a bit controver­
sial. Bulmer’s chicken, the “categories are in the world” position, has been de­
scribed as empirical, environment-driven, bottom-up, or objectivist, and these
are not synonymous. Likewise, the “egghead” position that “categories are in
the mind” has been called rational, constructive, top-down, experiential, and
embodied—and they are also not synonyms. See (Bulmer 1970). See also (Lakoff
1990), (Malt 1995).
[388][CogSci]

Is there a “universal grammar” or a “language faculty” that imposes
strong constraints on human language and cognition? (Chomsky 1965) and
(Jackendoff 1996) think so. Such proposals imply cognitive representations in
which categories are explicit structures in memory with associated instances
and properties. In contrast, generalized learning theories model category for­
mation as the adjustment of the patterns and weighting of connections in neural
processing networks that are not specialized for language in any way. Computa­
tional simulations of semantic networks can reproduce the experimental and be­
havioral results about language acquisition and semantic judgments that have
been used as evidence for explicit category representations without needing
anything like them. (Rogers and McClelland 2008) thoroughly review the explic­
it category models and then show how relatively simple learning models can do
without them.
[389][CogSci]

The debates about human category formation also extend to issues of
how children learn categories and categorization methods. Most psychologists
argue that category learning starts with general learning mechanisms that are
very perceptually based, but they do not agree whether to characterize these
changes as “stages” or as phases in a more complex dynamical system. Over
time more specific learning techniques evolve that focus on correlations among
perceptual properties (things with wings tend to have feathers), correlations
among properties and roles (things with eyes tend to eat), and ultimately corre­
lations among roles (things that eat tend to sleep). See (Smith and Thelen
2003).
[390][CogSci]

These three contexts were proposed by (Glushko, Maglio, Matlock, and
Barsalou 2008), who pointed out that cognitive science has focused on cultural

categorization and largely ignored individual and institutional contexts. They ar­
gue that taking a broader view of categorization highlights dimensions on which
it varies that are not apparent when only cultural categories are considered. For
example, institutional categories are usually designed and maintained using
prescriptive methods that have no analogues with cultural categories. There is a
difference between institutional categories created for people, and categories
created in institutions by computers in the predictive analytics, data mining
sense.
This quote comes from Plato’s Phaedrus dialogue, written around 370
BCE. Contemporary philosophers and cognitive scientists commonly invoke it in
discussions about whether “natural kinds” exist. . For example, see (Campbell,
O’Rourke, and Slater 2011), and (Hutchins 2010), (Atran 1987), and others have
argued that the existence of perceptual discontinuities is not sufficient to ac­
count for category formation. Instead, people assume that members of a biologi­
cal category must have an essence of co-occurring properties and these guide
people to focus on the salient differences, thereby creating categories. Property
clusters enable inferences about causality, which then builds a framework on
which additional categories can be created and refined. For example, if “having
wings” and “flying” are co-occurring properties that suggest a “bird” category,
wings are then inferred as the causal basis of flying, and wings become more sa­
lient.
[392][Phil]

Pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, parti­
cles, and numerals and other “parts of speech” are also grammatical categories,
but nouns carry most of the semantic weight.
[393][Ling]

In contrast, the set of possible interactions with even a simple object
like a banana is very large. We can pick, peel, slice, smash, eat, or throw a bana­
na, so instead of capturing this complexity in the meaning of banana it gets par­
celed into the verbs that can act on the banana noun. Doing so requires lan­
guages to use verbs to capture a broader and more abstract type of meaning
that is determined by the nouns with which they are combined. Familiar verbs
like “set,” “put,” and “get” have dozens of different senses as a result because
they go with so many different nouns. We set fires and we set tables, but fires
and tables have little in common. The intangible character of verbs and the
complexity of multiple meanings make it easier to focus instead on their associ­
ated nouns, which are often physical resources, and create organizing systems
that emphasize the latter rather than the former. We create organizing systems
that focus on verbs when we are categorizing actions, behaviors, or services
where the resources that are involved are less visible or less directly involved in
the supported interactions.
[394][CogSci]

Many languages have a system of grammatical gender in which all
nouns must be identified as masculine or feminine using definite articles (el and

[395][Ling]

la in Spanish, le and la in French, and so on) and corresponding pronouns. Lan­
guages also contrast in how they describe time, spatial relationships, and in
which things are treated as countable objects (one ox, two oxen) as opposed to
substances or mass nouns that do not have distinct singular and plural forms
(like water or dirt). (Deutscher 2011) carefully reviews and discredits the strong
Whorfian view and makes the case for a more nuanced perspective on linguistic
relativity. He also reviews much of Lera Boroditsky’s important work in this
area. George Lakoff’s book with the title Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things
(Lakoff 1990) provocatively points out differences in gender rules among lan­
guages; in an aboriginal language called Dyirbal many dangerous things, includ­
ing fire have feminine gender, meanwhile “fire” is masculine in Spanish (el feu­
go) and French (le feu).
This analysis comes from (Haviland 1998). More recently, Lera Boro­
ditsky has done many interesting studies and experiments about linguistic rela­
tivity. See (Boroditksy 2003) for an academic summary and (Boroditsky 2010,
2011) for more popular treatments.

This was ultimately reflected in complex mythological systems, such as
Greek mythology, where genealogical relationships between gods represented
category relationships among the phenomena with which they were associated.
As human knowledge grew and the taxonomies became more comprehensive

The typical syntactic constraint that tags are delimited by white space
encourages the creation of new categories by combining existing category
names using concatenation and camel case conventions; photos that could be
categorized as “Berkeley” and “Student” are sometimes tagged as “BerkeleyS­
tudent.” Similar generative processes for creating individual category names
are used with Twitter “hashtags” where tweets about events are often catego­
rized with an ad hoc tag that combines an event name and a year identifier like
“#NBAFinals16.”

Consider how the cultural category of “killing a person” is refined by the
legal system to distinguish manslaughter and different degrees of murder based
on the amount of intentionality and planning involved (e.g., first and second de­

general, the purpose of laws is to replace coarse judgments of categorization
based on overall similarity of facts with rule-based categorization based on spe­
cific dimensions or properties.

The particularities or idiosyncrasies of individual categorization systems
sometimes capture user expertise and knowledge that is not represented in the
institutional categories that replace them. Many of the readers of this book are
information professionals whose technological competence is central to their
work and which helps them to be creative. But for a great many other people,
information technology has enabled the routinization of work in offices, assem­

“downskilled” or “deskilled” the nature of work, destroying competence and en­
gendering a great deal of resistance from the affected workers.

Similar technical concerns arise in within-company and multi-company

character of the latter imposes greater complexity by introducing considera­

and prioritizing requirements, negotiating specifications that satisfy them, and
ensuring conformant implementations—without at any point giving any partici­
pating firm an advantage. See the OASIS Technical Committee Process for an

Legal disputes often reflect different interpretations of category mem­
bership and whether a list of category members is exhaustive or merely illustra­
tive. The legal principle of “implied exclusion”—expressio unius est exclusio al­
terius —says that if you “expressly name” or “designate” an enumeration of one
or more things, any thing that is not named is excluded, by implication. Howev­
er, prefacing the list with “such as,” “including,” or “like” implies that it is not a
strict enumeration because there might be other members.

The number of resources in each of these categories depends on the
age of the collection and the collector. We could be more precise here and say
“single atomic property” or otherwise more carefully define “property” in this
context as a characteristic that is basic and not easily or naturally decomposa­
ble into other characteristics. It would be possible to analyze the physical for­
mat of a music resource as a composition of size, shape, weight, and material
substance properties, but that is not how people normally think. Instead, they
treat physical format as a single property as we do in this example.

We need to think of alphabetic ordering or any other organizing princi­
ple in a logical way that does not imply any particular physical implementation.
Therefore, we do not need to consider which of these alphabetic categories exist

Another example: rules for mailing packages might use either size or
weight to calculate the shipping cost, and whether these rules are based on spe­

If you try hard, you can come up with situations in which this property
is important, as when the circus is coming to the island on a ferry or when you

Many information systems, applications, and programming languages
that work with hierarchical categories take advantage of this logical relation­
ship to infer inherited properties when they are needed rather than storing
them redundantly.

Similarly, clothing stores use intrinsic static properties when they
present merchandise arranged according to color and size; extrinsic static prop­
erties when they host branded displays of merchandise; intrinsic dynamic prop­
erties when they set aside a display for seasonal merchandise, from bathing
suits to winter boots; and extrinsic dynamic properties when a display area is
set aside for “Today’s Special.”

It might be possible to define “game,”but it requires a great deal of ab­
straction that obscures the “necessary and sufficient” tests. “To play a game is
to engage in activity directed toward bringing about a speciﬁc state of affairs,
using only means permitted by speciﬁc rules, where the means permitted by the
rules are more limited in scope than they would be in the absence of the rules,
and where the sole reason for accepting such limitation is to make possible such

The exact nature of the category representation to which the similarity
comparison is made is a subject of ongoing debate in cognitive science. Is it a
prototype, a central tendency or average of the properties shared by category
members, or it one or more exemplars, particular members that typify the cate­
gory. Or is it neither, as argued by connectionist modelers who view categories
as patterns of network activation without any explicitly stored category repre­
sentation? Fortunately, these distinctions do not matter for our discussion here.
A recent review is (Rips, Smith, and Medin 2012).

Another situation where similarity has been described as a “mostly
vacuous” explanation for categorization is with abstract categories or meta­
phors. Goldstone says “an unrewarding job and a relationship that cannot be
ended may both be metaphorical prisons... and may seem similar in that both
conjure up a feeling of being trapped... but this feature is almost as abstract as
the category to be explained.” (Goldstone 1994), p. 149.

Because Tversky's model separately considers the sets of nonoverlapping features, it is possible to accurately capture similarity judgments
when they are not symmetric, i.e., when A is judged more similar to B than B is

pothesis that fits the data is a general principle of Bayesian learning with ran­
dom samples.

Consider what happens if two businesses model the concept of “ad­
dress” in a customer database with different granularity. One may have a coarse
“Address” field in the database, which stores a street address, city, state, and
Zip code all in one block, while the other stores the components “StreetAd­
dress,” “City,” and “PostalCode” In separate fields. The more granular model
can be automatically transformed into the less granular one, but not vice versa
(Glushko and McGrath 2005).

Statistician and baseball fan Nate Silver rejected a complex system that
used twenty-six player categories for predicting baseball performance because
“it required as much art as science to figure out what group a player belonged
in.” (Silver 2012, p, 83). His improved system used the technique of “nearest
neighbor” analysis to identify current baseball players whose minor league sta­
tistics were most similar to the current minor league players being evaluated.
(See §7.5.3.3 Categories Created by Clustering (page 372)).

Silver later became famous for his extremely accurate predictions of the 2008
US presidential elections. He is the founder and editor of the FiveThirtyEight
blog, so named because there are 538 senators and representatives in the US
Congress.

(Rosch 1999) calls this the principle of cognitive economy, that “what
one wishes to gain from one’s categories is a great deal of information about the
environment while conserving finite resources as much as possible. [...] It is to
the organism’s advantage not to differentiate one stimulus from another when
that differentiation is irrelevant to the purposes at hand.” (Pages 3-4.)

For example, some linguists think of “English” as a broad category en­
compassing multiple languages or dialects, such as “Standard British English,”
“Standard American English,” and “Appalachian English.”

[436][Ling]

If we are concerned with linguistic diversity and the survival of minority lan­
guages, we might categorize some languages as endangered in order to mobi­
lize language preservation efforts. We could also categorize languages in terms
of shared linguistic ancestors (“Romance languages,” for example), in terms of
what kinds of sounds they make use of, by how well we speak them, by regions
they are commonly spoken in, whether they are signed or unsigned, and so on.
We could also expand our definition of the languages category to include artifi­
cial computer languages, or body language, or languages shared by people and
their pets—or thinking more metaphorically, we might include the language of
fashion.
For example, you can test whether a number is prime by dividing it by
every number smaller than its square root, but this algorithm is ridiculously im­
practical for any useful application. Many cryptographic systems multiply prime
numbers to create encryption keys, counting on the difficulty of factoring them
to protect the keys; so, proving that ever larger numbers are prime is very im­
portant. See (Crandall and Pomerance 2006).
[437][Com]

If you are wondering why prime numbers aren’t considered an enumerative cat­
egory given that every number that is prime already exists, it is because we
have not found all of them yet, and we need to test through to infinity.
This example comes from (Perlman 1984), who introduced the idea of
“natural artificial languages” as those designed to be easy to learn and use be­
cause they employ mnemonic symbols, suggestive names, and consistent syntax.

When the US Congress revised copyright law in 1976 it codified a “fair
use” provision to allow for some limited uses of copyrighted works, but fair use
in the digital era is vastly different today; website caching to improve perform­
ance and links that return thumbnail versions of images are fair uses that were
not conceivable when the law was written. A law that precisely defined fair uses
using contemporary technology would have quickly become obsolete, but one
written more qualitatively to enable interpretation by the courts has remained
viable. See (Samuelson 2009).

“Rigid” might sound negative, but a rigidly defined resource is also pre­
cisely defined. Precise definition is essential when creating, capturing, and re­
trieving data and when information about resources in different organizing sys­
tems needs to be combined or compared. For example, in a traditional relational
database, each table contains a field, or combination of fields, known as a pri­
mary key, which is used to define and restrict membership in the table. A table
of email messages in a database might define an email message as a unique
combination of sender address, recipient address, and date/time when the mes­
sage was sent, by enforcing a primary key on a combination of these fields. Sim­
ilar to category membership based on a single, monothetic set of properties,
membership in this email message table is based on a single set of required cri­
teria. An item without a recipient address cannot be admitted to the table. In
categorization terms, the item is not a member of the “email message” class be­
cause it does not have all the properties necessary for membership.
[441][Com]

Like data schemas, programming classes specify and enforce rules in
the construction and manipulation of data. However, programming classes, like
other implementations that are characterized by specificity and rule enforce­
ment, can vary widely in the degree to which rules are specified and enforced.
While some class definitions are very rigid, others are more flexible. Some lan­
guages have abstract types that have no instances but serve to provide a com­
mon ancestor for specific implemented types.
[442][Com]

The existence of chapters might suggest that an item is a novel; how­
ever, a lack of chapters need not automatically indicate that an item is not a
novel. Some novels are hypertexts that encourage readers to take alternative
paths. Many of the writings by James Joyce and Samuel Beckett are “stream of
consciousness” works that lack a coherent plot, yet they are widely regarded as
novels.
[443][CogSci]

See (Silver 2012). Over reliance on data that is readily available is a
decision-making heuristic proposed by (Tversky and Kahneman 1974), who de­
veloped the psychological foundations for behavioral economics. (See the side­
bar, Behavioral Economics (page 495).)
[444][DS]

To be precise, this “difference of proportions” calculation uses an algo­
rithm that also uses the logarithm of the proportions to calculate entropy, a
measure of the uncertainty in a probability distribution. An entropy of zero
means that the outcome can be perfectly predicted, and entropy increases as
outcomes are less predictable. The information gain for an attribute is how
much it reduces entropy after it is used to subdivide a dataset.

Unfortunately, this rational data-driven process for classifying loan appli­
cations as “Approved” or “Denied” was abandoned during the “housing bubble”
of the early 2000s. Because lending banks could quickly sell their mortgages to
investment banks who bundled them into mortgage-backed securities, appli­

cants were approved without any income verification for “subprime” loans that
initially had very low adjustable interest rates. Of course, when the rates in­
creased substantially a few years later, defaults and foreclosures skyrocketed.
This sad story is told in an informative, entertaining, but depressing manner in
“The Big Short” (Lewis, 2010) and in a 2015 movie with the same name.
Machine learning algorithms differ in which properties they use in how
they select them. A straightforward method is to run the algorithms using differ­
ent sets of properties, and select the set that yields the best result. However, it
can be very computationally expensive to run algorithms multiple times, espe­
cially when the number of properties is large. A faster alternative is to select or
filter features based on how well they predict the classification. The information
gain calculation discussed in §7.5.3.1 Probabilistic Decision Trees (page 367) is
an example of a filter method.
[447][Com]

Naïve Bayes classifiers make the simplifying assumption that the properties are
independent, an assumption that is rarely correct, which is why the approach is
called naïve. For example, a document that contains the word “insurance” is al­
so likely to contain “beneficiary,” so their presence in messages is not independ­
ent.
Nevertheless, even though the independence assumption is usually violated, Na­
ive Bayes classifiers often perform very well. Furthermore, treating properties
as independent means that the classifier needs much less data to train than if
we had to calculate the conditional probabilities of all combination of proper­
ties. Instead, we just have to count separately the number of times each proper­
ty occurs with each of the two classification outcomes.
See (Blanzieri and Bryl 2009) for a review of the spam problem and the
policy and technology methods for fighting it. (Upsana and Chakravarty 2010) is
somewhat more recent and more narrowly focused on text classification techni­
ques.

A very thorough yet highly readable introduction to Active Learning is (Settles
2012).
In particular, documents are usually represented as vectors of
frequency-weighted terms. Other approaches start more directly with the simi­
larity measure, obtained either by direct judgments of the similarity of each pair
of items or by indirect measures like the accuracy in deciding whether two
sounds, colors, or images are the same or different. The assumption is that the
confusability of two items reflects how similar they are.
[449][Com]

Unlike hierarchical clustering methods that have a clear stopping rule
when they create the root category, k-means clustering methods run until the
centroids of the categorize stabilize. Furthermore, because the k-means algo­
rithm is basically just hill-climbing, and the initial category “seed” items are

random, it can easily get stuck in a local optimum. So it is desirable to try many
different starting configurations for different choices of K.
In addition, the complex feature representations of neural networks com­
pute very precise similarity measurements, which enable searches for specific
images or that find duplicate ones.

Structure Mapping theory was proposed in (Gentner 1983), and the
Structure Mapping Engine followed a few years later (Falkenhainer et al 1989).
The SME was criticized for relying on hand-coded knowledge representations, a
limitation overcome by (Turney 2008), who used text processing techniques to
extract the semantic relationships used by Structure Mapping.

8.1 Introduction
In Chapter 6 we discussed different types of semantic relationships and contras­
ted abstract relationships between categories that define a semantic hierarchy
like
Meat → is-a → Food
with concrete relationships involving specific people like members of the Simp­
son family:
Homer Simpson → is-a → Husband

The Discipline of Organizing

When we make an assertion that a particular instance like Homer Simpson is a
member of class, we are classifying the instance.
Classification, the systematic assignment of resources to intentional categories,
is the focus of this chapter. In Chapter 7, Categorization: Describing Resource
Classes and Types, we described categories created by people as cognitive and
linguistic models for applying prior knowledge and we discussed a set of princi­
ples for creating categories and category systems. We explained how cultural
categories serve as the foundations upon which individual and institutional cate­
gories are based. Institutional categories are most often created in abstract and
information-intensive domains where unambiguous and precise categories ena­
ble classification to be purposeful and principled. Computational categories in­
herited by supervised learning techniques are usually as interpretable as those
created by people, but categories created by unsupervised machine learning
techniques are statistical patterns that might or might not be interpretable.
A system of categories and its attendant rules or access methods is typically
called a classification scheme or just the classifications. A system of categories
captures the distinctions and relationships among its resources that are most
important in a domain and for a particular context of use, creating a reference
model or conceptual roadmap for its users. This classification creates the struc­
ture and support for the interactions that human or computational agents per­
form. For example, research libraries and bookstores do not use the same clas­
sifications to organize books, but the categories they each use are appropriate
for their contrasting types of collections and the different kinds of browsing and
searching activities that take place in each context. Likewise, the scientific clas­
sifications for animals used by biologists contrast with those used in pet stores
because the latter have no need for the precise differentiation enabled by the
former.

Navigating This Chapter
Most of the chapter is a survey of topics that span the broad range of
how classifications are used in organizing systems. These include
enumerative classification (§8.3), faceted classification (§8.4),
activity-based classification (§8.5), and computational classification
(§8.6). Because classification and standardization are closely related,
we also analyze standards and standards making as they apply to or­
ganizing systems. Throughout, we observe how personal, institution­
al, cultural, linguistic, political, religious, and even artistic biases can
affect otherwise principled and purposeful classification schemes. We
finish the chapter with §8.7 Key Points in Chapter Eight (page 429).

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

8.1.1 Classification vs. Categorization
Classification requires a system of categories, so not everyone distinguishes
classification from categorization. Batley, for example, says classification is “im­
posing some sort of structure on our understanding of our environment,” a
vague definition that applies equally well to categorization.
In the discipline of organizing, the definition of classification is narrower and
more formal. The contrasts among cultural, individual, and institutional catego­
ries in §7.2 The What and Why of Categories (page 325) yield a precise defini­
tion of classification: The systematic assignment of resources to a system of in­
tentional categories, often institutional ones. This definition highlights the in­
tentionality behind the system of categories, the systematic processes for using
them, and implies the greater requirements for governance and maintenance
that are absent for cultural categories and most individual ones.

8.1.2 Classification vs. Tagging
Precise and reliable classification is possible when the shared properties of a
collection of resources are used in a principled and systematic manner. This
method of classification is essential to satisfy institutional and commercial pur­
poses. However, this degree of rigor might be excessive for personal classifica­
tions and for classifications of resources in social or informal contexts.
Instead, a weaker approach to organizing resources is to use any property of a
resource and any vocabulary to describe it, regardless of how well it differenti­
ates it from other resources to create a system of categories. This method of or­
ganizing resources is most often called tagging (§5.2.2.3), but it has also been
called social classification.454[Web]
Tagging is often used in personal organizing systems, but is social when it
serves goals to convey information, develop a community, or manage reputation.
Regardless of its name, however, tagging is popular for organizing and rating
photos, websites, email messages, or other web-based resources or web-based
descriptions of physical resources like stores and restaurants.
The distinction between classification and tagging was blurred when Thomas
Vander Wal coined the term “folksonomy” —combining “folk” and “taxonomy”
(which is a classification; see §6.3.1.1 Inclusion (page 279)) —to describe the
collection of tags for a particular web site or application.455[Web] Folksonomies
are often displayed in the form of a tag cloud, where the frequency with which
the tag is used throughout the site determines the size of the text in the tag
cloud. The tag cloud emerges through the bottom-up aggregation of user tags
and is a statistical construct, rather than a semantic one.456[IA]
Tagging seems insufficiently principled to be considered classification. Tagging
a photo as “red” or “car” is an act of resource description, not classification, be­

cause the other tags that would serve as the alternative classifications are un­
specified. Furthermore, when tagging principles are followed at all, they are
likely to be idiosyncratic ones that were not pre-determined or arrived at
through an analysis of goals and requirements.
Noticeably, some uses of tags treat them as category labels, turning tagging into
classification. Many websites and resources encourage users to assign “Like” or
“+1” tags to them, and because these tags are pre-defined, they are category
choices in an implied classification system; for example, we can consider “Like”
as an alternative to a “Not liked enough” category.
When users or communities establish sets of principles to govern their tagging
practices, tagging is even more like classification. Such a tagging system can be
called a tagsonomy, a neologism we have invented to describe more systematic
tagging. For example, a tagsonomy could predetermine tags as categories to be
assigned to particular contents of a blog post, or specify the level of abstraction
and granularity for assigning tags without predetermining them (§7.4 Category
Design Issues and Implications (page 356)). Some people use multiple user ac­
counts for the same application to establish distinct personas or contexts (e.g.,
personal vs. business photo collections) as a way to make their tagsonomies
more distinct.
Making these decisions about tagging content and form and applying them in
the tagging process transforms an ad hoc set of tags into a principled tagsono­
my. When tagging is introduced in a business setting, more pragmatic purposes
and more systematic tagging—for example, by using tags from lists of depart­
ments or products—also tends to create tagsonomic classification.457[Bus]
“Tagging documents by computer,” or multi-label classification, is a glib way to
describe topic modeling, an unsupervised learning technique for organizing and
summarizing collections of unstructured documents by discovering patterns or
clusters in the words they contain. The basic intuition behind topic modeling is
that the words in a document are probabilistic indications of what the document
is about; a document that contains words like “election, government, and candi­
date” is probably about the “politics” topic, while words like “adore, wedding,
and marriage” are good indications of a “love” topic. Topic models are not quite
tagging because the words they identify to describe documents are not atomic
tags or labels explicitly assigned to individual documents. Instead, topics are
more like themes that different documents are more or less likely to contain.
Topic models have been used to implement user interfaces for browsing large
document collections because they let a user explore using themes instead of
specific search terms. In digital humanities, topic models have been used to dis­
cover changes in “what’s written about” by some author or resource (like a
newspaper) over time. Web commerce companies use topic models to organize
books or products for their recommendation engines.458[DS]

Informatics Edition

8.1.3 Classification vs. Physical Arrangement
We have often stressed the principle in the discipline of organizing that logical
issues must be separated from implementation issues. (See §1.6 The Concept of
“Organizing Principle” (page 43), §5.3.5 Designing the Description Form (page
251), and §6.7 The Implementation Perspective (page 308)) With classification
we separate the conceptual act of assigning a resource to a category from the
subsequent but often incidental act of putting it in some physical or digital stor­
age location. This focus on the logical essence of classification is elegantly ex­
pressed in a definition by Gruenberg: Classification is “a higher order thinking
skill requiring the fusion of the naturalist’s eye for relationships... with the logi­
cian’s desire for structured order... the mathematician’s compulsion to achieve
consistent, predictable results... and the linguist’s interest in explicit and tacit
expressions of meaning.”
Taking a conceptual or cognitive perspective on classification contrasts with
much conventional usage in library science, where classification is mostly asso­
ciated with arranging tangible items on shelves, emphasizing the “parking”
function that realizes the “marking” function of identifying the category to
which the resource belongs.
From a library science or collection curation perspective, it seems undeniable
that when the resources being classified are physical or tangible things such as
books, paintings, animals, or cooking pots, the end result of the classification
activity is that some resource has been placed in some physical location. More­
over, the placement of physical resources can be influenced by the physical con­
text in which they are organized. Once placed, the physical context often em­
bodies some aspects of the organization when similar or related resources are
arranged in nearby locations. In libraries and bookstores, this adjacency facili­
tates the serendipitous discovery of resources, as anyone well knows who has
found an interesting book by browsing the shelves.
However, once we broaden the scope of organizing to include digital resources,
it is clear that we rely on their logical classifications when we interact with
them, not whether they reside on a computer in Berkeley or Bangalore. It is bet­
ter to emphasize that a classification system is foremost a specification for the
logical arrangement of resources because there are usually many possible and
often arbitrary mappings of logical references to physical locations.

8.1.4 Classification Schemes
A classification scheme is a realization of one or more organizing principles.
Physical resources are often classified according to their tangible or perceivable
properties. As we discussed in §7.3.2 Single Properties (page 338) and
§7.3.3 Multiple Properties (page 340), when properties take on only a small set of
discrete values, a classification system naturally emerges in which each catego­
8.1 Introduction

395

The Discipline of Organizing

ry is defined by one property value or some particular combination of property
values. Classification schemes in which all possible categories to which resour­
ces can be assigned are defined explicitly are enumerative. For example, the
enumerative classification for a personal collection of music recorded on physi­
cal media might have categories for CDs, DVDs, vinyl albums, 8-track cartridg­
es, reel-to-reel tape, and tape cassettes; every music resource fits into one and
only one of these categories.
When multiple resource properties are considered in a fixed sequence, each
property creates another level in the system of categories and the classification
scheme is hierarchical or taxonomic. (See §6.3.1.1 Inclusion (page 279).)
For information resources, their aboutness is usually more important than their
physical properties. For example, a professor planning a new course might or­
ganize candidate articles for the syllabus in a fixed set of categories, one for
each potential lecture topic. But it is more challenging to enumerate all the sub­
jects or topics that a larger collection of resources might be about. The Library
of Congress Classification (LCC) is a hierarchical and enumerative scheme with
a very detailed set of subject categories because books can be about almost any­
thing. We discuss the LCC more in §8.3 Bibliographic Classification (page 412).
In addition to or instead of their aboutness, information resources are some­
times organized using intrinsic properties like author names or creation dates.
Our professor might primarily organize his collection of articles by author
name, and when he plans a new course, he might put those he selects for the
syllabus into a classification system with one category for every scheduled lec­
ture.
Because names and dates can take on a great many values, an organizing prin­
ciple like alphabetical or chronological ordering is unlikely to enumerate in ad­
vance an explicit category for each possible value. Instead, we can consider
these organizing principles as creating an implicit or latent classification system
in which the categories are generated only as needed. For example, the Q cate­
gory only exists in an alphabetical scheme if there is a resource whose name
starts with Q.
Many resource domains have multiple properties that might be used to define a
classification scheme. For example, wine can be classified by type of grape (va­
rietal), color, flavor, price, winemaker, region of origin (appellation), blending
style, and other properties. Furthermore, people differ in their knowledge or
preferences about these properties; some people choose wine based on its price
and varietal, while others studiously compare winemakers and appellations.
Each order of considering the properties creates a different hierarchical classifi­
cation, and using all of them would create a very deep and unwieldy system.
Moreover, many different hierarchies might be required to satisfy divergent
preferences. An alternative classification scheme for domains like these is
396

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

faceted classification, a type of classification system that takes a set of resource
properties and then generates only those categories for combinations that ac­
tually occur.
The most common types of facets are enumerative (mutually exclusive); Boolean
(yes or no); hierarchical or taxonomic (logical containment); and spectrum (a
range of numerical values). We discuss faceted classification in detail (in
§8.4 Faceted Classification (page 416)) because it is very frequently used in on­
line classifications. Faceted schemes enable easier search and browsing of large
resource collections like those for retail sites and museums than hierarchical
enumerative schemes. In library science a classification system that builds cate­
gories by combination of facets is sometimes also called analytico-synthetic.

8.1.5 Classification and Standardization
Classifications impose order on resources. Standards do the same by making
distinctions, either implicitly or explicitly, between “standard” and “nonstan­
dard” ways of creating, organizing, and using resources. Classification and
standardization are not identical, but they are closely related. Some classifica­
tions become standards, and some standards define new classifications. Institu­
tional categories (§7.2.3) are of two broad types.

8.1.5.1 Institutional Taxonomies
Institutional taxonomies are classifications designed to make it more likely that
people or computational agents will organize and interact with resources in the
same way. Among the thousands of standards published by the International Or­
ganization for Standardization (ISO) are many institutional taxonomies that gov­
ern the classification of resources and products in agriculture, aviation, con­
struction, energy, healthcare, information technology, transportation, and al­
most every industry sector.461[Bus]
Institutional taxonomies are especially important in libraries and knowledge
management. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress
Classification (LCC) enable different libraries to arrange books in the same cate­
gories, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in
clinical psychology enables different doctors to assign patients to the same diag­
nostic and insurance categories.

8.1.5.2 Institutional Semantics
Systems of institutional semantics offer precisely defined abstractions or infor­
mation components (§4.3.3 Identity and Information Components (page 185))
needed to ensure that information can be efficiently exchanged and used. Or­
ganizing systems that use different information models often cannot share and
combine information without tedious negotiation and excessive rework.
8.1 Introduction

397

The Discipline of Organizing

Automating transactions with suppliers and customers in a supply chain re­
quires that all the parties use the same data format or formats that can be
transformed to be interoperable. Retrofitting or replacing these applications to
enable efficient interoperability is often possible, and it is usually desirable for
the firm to develop or adopt enterprise standards for information exchange
models rather than pay the recurring transaction costs to integrate or transform
incompatible formats.
Standard semantics are especially important in industries or markets that have
significant network effects where the value of a product depends on the number
of interoperable or compatible products—these include much of the information
and service economies.
An example of a system of institutional semantics is the Universal Business Lan­
guage (UBL) a library of about 2000 semantic “building blocks” for common
concepts like “Address,” “Item,” “Payment,” and “Party” along with nearly 100
document types assembled from the standard components. UBL is widely used
to facilitate the automated exchange of transactional documents in procure­
ment, logistics, inventory management, collaborative planning and forecasting,
and payment.463[Bus]

8.1.5.3 Specifications vs. Standards
Implementing an organizing system of significant scope and complexity in a ro­
bust and maintainable fashion requires precise descriptions of the resources it
contains, their formats, the classes, relations, structures and collections in
which they participate, and the processes that ensure their efficient and effec­
tive use. Rigorous descriptions like these are often called “specifications” and
there are well-established practices for developing good ones.
There is a subtle but critical distinction between “specifications” and “stand­
ards.” Any person, firm, or ad hoc group of people or firms can create a specifi­
cation and then use it or attempt to get others to use it.464[Bus] In contrast, a
standard is a published specification that is developed and maintained by con­
sensus of all the relevant stakeholders in some domain by following a defined
and transparent process, usually under the auspices of a recognized standards
organization.465[Bus] In addition, implementations of standards often are subject
to conformance tests that establish the completeness and accuracy of the imple­
mentation. This means that users can decide either to implement the specifica­
tion themselves or choose from other conforming implementations.
The additional rigor and transparency when specifications are developed and
maintained through a standards process often makes them fairer and gives
them more legitimacy. Governments often require or recommend these de jure
standards, especially those that are “open” or “royalty free” because they are

398

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

typically supported by multiple vendors, minimizing the cost of adoption and
maximizing their longevity.
For example, work on UBL has gone on for over a decade in a technical commit­
tee under the auspices of a standards development consortium called the Or­
ganization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS),
which has developed scores of standards for web services and informationintensive industries.
Despite these important distinctions between “specifications” and “standards,”
however, in conventional usage “standard” is often simply a synonym for “domi­
nant or widely-adopted specification.” These de facto standards, in contrast with
the de jure standards created by standards organizations, are typically created
by the dominant firm or firms in an industry, by a new firm that is first to use a
new technology or innovative method, or by a non-profit entity like a foundation
that focuses on a particular domain.466[Bus]
De facto standards and ad hoc standards often co-exist and compete in “stand­
ards wars,” especially in information-intensive domains and industries with rap­
id innovation. Standards “wars” tend to occur when different firms or groups of
firms develop two or more standards that tend to address the same needs. Not
surprisingly, the competing standards are often incompatible on purpose. At
first this lets each standard attract customers with features not enabled by the
other, but it ends up locking them in by imposing switching costs. Current ex­
amples include Google vs. Apple on mobile phones and Kindle versus Apple on
ebook readers.467[Bus]
For example, the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) is the world’s most widely
used library classification system, and most people treat it as a standard. In
fact, the DDC is proprietary and it is maintained and licensed for use by the On­
line Computer Library Center (OCLC). Similarly, the DSM is maintained and
published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and it earns the APA
many millions of dollars a year.
In contrast, de jure standards include the Library of Congress Classifica­
tion (LCC), developed under the auspices of the US government, the familiar
MARC record format used in online library catalogs (ISO 2709), and its Ameri­
can counterpart ANSI Z39.2.
As a result, even though it would be technically correct to argue that “while all
standards are specifications, not all specifications are standards,” this distinc­
tion is hard to maintain in practice.

The Discipline of Organizing

8.1.5.4 Mandated Classifications
Standards are often imposed by governments to protect the interests of their
citizens by coordinating or facilitating activities that might otherwise not be
possible or safe. Some of them primarily concern public or product safety and
are only tangentially relevant to systems for organizing information. Others are
highly relevant, especially those that specify the formats and content of infor­
mation exchange; many European governments require firms doing business
with the government to adopt UBL.469[Law]
Other government standards that are important in organizing systems are those
that express requirements for classification and retention of auditing informa­
tion for financial activities, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or for non-retention
of personal information, such as HIPAA and FERPA.470[Bus]

8.2 Understanding Classification
Classifications arrange resources to support discovery, selection, combination,
integration, analysis, and other purposeful activity in every organizing system. A
classification of diseases facilitates diagnosis and development of medical pro­
cedures, as well as accounting and billing. In addition, classifications facilitate
understanding of a domain by highlighting the important resources and rela­
tionships in it, supporting the training of people who work in the domain and
their acquisition of specialized skills for it.
We consider classification to be systematic when it follows principles that gov­
ern the structure of categories and their relationships. However, being system­
atic and principled does not necessarily ensure that a classification will be un­
biased or satisfy all users’ requirements. For example, the zoning, environmen­
tal, economic development, and political district classifications that overlay dif­
ferent parts of a city determine the present and future allocation of services and
resources, and over time influence whether the city thrives or decays. These
classifications reflect tradeoffs and negotiations among numerous participants,
including businesses, lobbyists, incumbent politicians, donors to political par­
ties, real estate developers, and others with strong self-interests.

8.2.1 Classification Is Purposeful
Categories often arise naturally, but by definition classifications do not because
they are systems of categories that have been intentionally designed for some
purpose. Every classification brings together resources that go together, and in
doing so differentiates among them. However, bringing resources together
would be pointless without reasons for finding, accessing, and interacting with
them later.

8.2.1.1 Classifications Are Reference Models
A classification creates a semantic or conceptual roadmap to a domain by high­
lighting the properties and relationships that distinguish the resources in it.
This reference model facilitates learning, comprehension, and use of organizing
systems within the domain. Standard classifications like those used in libraries
enable people to rely on one system that they can use to locate resources in
many libraries. Standard business, job, and product classifications enable the
reliable collection, analysis, and interchange of economic data and resources.
Another important use of standard classifications created by people is as a “gold
standard” for comparison with unsupervised computational classifications car­
ried out on the same collection of resources or in the same domain. Presumably
no unsupervised classifier could exactly reproduce the classifications created by
careful experts.

8.2.1.2 Classifications Support Interactions
A classification creates structure in the organizing system that increases the va­
riety and capability of the interactions it can support. With physical resources,
classification increases useful co-location; in kitchens, for example, keeping re­
sources that are used together near each other (e.g., baking ingredients) makes
cooking and cleanup more efficient (see “activity-based” classification in §8.5).
Classification makes systems more usable when it is manifested in the arrange­
ment of resource descriptions or controls in user interface components like list
boxes, tabs, buttons, function menus, and structured lists of search results.471[IA]
A typical mapping between the logic of a classification scheme and a user inter­
face is illustrated in Figure 8.1, Classification and Interactions.
How a business classifies its product or service strongly influences whether a
customer can find it; this is the essential task of marketing. The business of
“search engine optimization” exists to help a firm with a web presence choose
the categories and descriptive terms that will improve its ranking in search re­
sults and attract the number of types of customer it desires.472[Web] How a cus­
tomer interacts with a supplier is influenced by how the supplier classifies its
offerings in its shopping aisles or catalogs; the “science of shopping” uses crea­
tive classifications and co-location of goods to shape browsing behavior and en­
courage impulse buying.473[Bus] In business-to-business contexts, standard classi­
fications for business processes and their application interfaces enable firms to
more easily build and maintain supply chains and distribution networks that in­
terconnect many business partners.474[Bus]

Good user interface design creates a clear mapping between the logic of a clas­
sification scheme and the selection methods and arrangements presented to
users. Categories that are mutually exclusive imply different tabs or other visu­
alizations that imply a single selection, for example.

Classification In A Novel User Interface

The meat from animals used as food is classified into numerous “cuts”
based on its origin. In the US, these classifications are standardized by the
Department of Agriculture to ensure that meat is labeled correctly. The
most natural way to convey the classification system is to label the parts of
the animal in a diagram, because this binds each logical category to the
“user interface.”

8.2.2 Classification Is Principled
§7.3 Principles for Creating Categories (page 337) explained principles for creat­
ing categories, including enumeration, single properties, multiple properties
and hierarchy, probabilistic co-occurrence of properties, theory and goal-based
categorization. It logically follows that the principles considered in designing
categories are embodied in classifications that use those categories. However,
when we say, “classification is principled,” we are going further to say that the
processes of assigning resources to categories and maintaining the classifica­
tion scheme over time must also follow principles.
8.2 Understanding Classification

403

The Discipline of Organizing

The design and use of a classification system involves many choices about its
purposes, scope, scale, intended lifetime, extensibility, and other considerations.
Principled classification means that once those design choices are made they
should be systematically and consistently followed.
Principled does not necessarily equate to “good,” because many of the choices
can be arbitrary and others may involve tradeoffs that depend on the nature of
the resources, the purposes of the classification, the amount of effort available,
the complexity of the domain, and the capabilities of the people doing the classi­
fication and of the people using it (see §7.4 Category Design Issues and Implica­
tions (page 356)). Every classification system is biased in one way or another
(see §8.3 Bibliographic Classification (page 412)).
Consider the classifications of resources in a highly-organized kitchen. (See
§12.5 Organizing a Kitchen (page 566)). Tableware, dishes, pots and pans, spices
and food provisions, and other resources have dedicated locations determined
by a set of intersecting requirements and organizing principles. There is no
written specification, and other people organize their kitchens differently.
On the other hand, complex institutional classification systems like those used
in libraries or government agencies are implemented with detailed specifica­
tions, methods, protocols, and guidelines. The people who apply these methods
in the field have studied the protocols in school or they have received extensive
on-the-job training to ensure that they apply them correctly, consistently, and in
accordance with the specifications and guidelines.

8.2.2.1 Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme
Some of the most important principles that lead us to say that classification is
principled are those that guide the design of the classification scheme in the
first place. These principles are fundamental in the discipline of library science
but they apply more broadly to other domains.
The warrant principle concerns the justification for the choice of categories and
the names given to them. The principle of literary warrant holds that a classifi­
cation must be based only on the specific resources that are being classified. In
the library context, this ad hoc principle that builds a classification from a par­
ticular collection principle is often posed in opposition to a more philosophical
or epistemological perspective, first articulated by Francis Bacon in the seven­
teenth century, that a classification should be universal and must handle all
knowledge and all possible resources. The principle of scientific warrant argues
that only the categories recognized by the scientists or experts in a domain
should be used in a classification system, and it is often opposed by the princi­
ple of use or user warrant, which chooses categories and descriptive terms ac­
cording to their frequency of use by everyone, not just experts. With classifica­
tions of physical resources like those in a kitchen, we see object warrant, where
404

similar objects are put together, but more frequently the justifying principle will
be one of use warrant, where resources are organized based on how they are
used.

is necessary to accommodate every­
thing in the store. Kitchen goods will
be grouped together in a few aisles on a single floor. But a specialty kitchen
store or a wholesale kitchen supply store for restaurants would classify much
more precisely because of the restricted resource domain and the greater ex­
pertise of those who want to buy things there. An entire section might be dedi­
cated just to knives, organized by knife type, manufacturer, quality of steel, and
other categories that are not used in the kitchen section of the department
store.477[CogSci]
The precision or enumerativeness of a classification scheme increases the simi­
larity of resources that are assigned to the same category and sharpens the dis­
tinctions between resources in different categories. However, when different
classifications must be combined, mismatches in their precision or granularity
can create challenges (see §10.3 Reorganizing Resources for Interactions (page
499)).

8.2.2.2 Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories
The uniqueness principle means the categories in a classification scheme are
mutually exclusive. Thus, when a logical concept is assigned to a particular cat­
egory, it cannot simultaneously be assigned to another category. Resources,
however, can be assigned to several categories if they embody several concepts
8.2 Understanding Classification

405

The Discipline of Organizing

represented by those different categories. This can present a challenge when a
physical storage solution is based on storing resources according to its assigned
category in a logical classification system. This is not a serious problem for re­
source types like technical equipment or tools, for which the properties used to
classify them are highly salient, and that have very narrow and predictable con­
texts of use. It is also not a problem for highly-specialized information resources
like scientific research reports or government economic data, which might end
up in only one specialized class. However, many resources are inherently more
difficult to classify because they have less salient properties or because they
have many more possible uses.
We face this kind of problem all the time. For example, should we store a pair of
scissors in the kitchen or in the office? One solution is to buy a second pair of
scissors so that scissors can be kept in both locations where they are typically
used, but this is not practical for many types of resources and this principle
would be difficult to apply in a systematic manner.
Many books are about multiple subjects. A self-help book about coping with
change in a business setting might reasonably be classified as either about ap­
plied psychology or about business. It is not helpful that book titles are often
poor clues to their content; Who Moved My Cheese? is in fact a self-help book
about coping with change in a business setting. Its Library of Congress Classifi­
cation is BF 637, “Applied Psychology,” and at UC Berkeley it is kept in the busi­
ness school library.
The general solution to satisfying the uniqueness principle in library classifica­
tions when resources do not clearly fit in a single category is to invent and fol­
low a detailed set of often arbitrary rules. Usually, the primary subject of the
book is used for assigning a category, which will then determine the book’s
place on a shelf.

8.2.2.3 Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time
Most personal classifications are created in response to a specific situation to
solve an emerging organizational challenge. As a consequence, personal classifi­
cation systems change in an ad hoc or opportunistic manner during their limited
lifetimes. For example, the classification schemes in your kitchen or closet are
deconstructed and disappear when you move and take your possessions to a dif­
ferent house or apartment. Your efforts to re-implement the classifications will
be influenced by the configuration of shelves and cabinets in your new resi­
dence, so they will not be exactly the same.
In contrast, the institutional classification schemes for many library resources,
culturally or scientifically-important artifacts, and much of the information cre­
ated or collected by businesses, governments and researchers might have use­
ful lives of decades or centuries. Classification systems like these can only be
406

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

changed incrementally to avoid disruption of the work flows of the organization.
We described maintaining resources as an activity in all organizing systems
(§3.5 Maintaining Resources (page 133)) and the issues of persistence, effectivi­
ty, authenticity, and provenance that emerge with resources over time (§4.5 Re­
sources over Time (page 198)). Much of this previous discussion applies in a
straightforward manner to maintaining classifications over time.
However, some additional issues arise with classifications over time. The war­
rant principle (§8.2.2.1) implicitly treats the justification for designing and nam­
ing categories as a one-time decision. This is reasonable if you are organizing a
collection of bibliographic resources or common types of physical resources like
printed books, clothing or butterflies. However, in domains where the resources
are active, change their state or implementation, or otherwise have a probabilis­
tic character it might be necessary to revisit warrant and the decisions based on
it from time to time. Put another way, if the world that you are sampling from or
describing has some randomness or change in it, the categories and descrip­
tions you imposed on it probably need to change as well. It often happens that
the meaning of an underlying category can change, along with its relative and
absolute importance with respect to the other categories in the classification
system. Categories sometimes change slowly, but they can also change quickly
and radically as a result of technological, process, or geopolitical innovation or
events. Entirely new types of resources and bodies of knowledge can appear in
a short time. Consider what the categories of “travel,” “entertainment,” “com­
puting,” and “communication” mean today compared to just a decade or two
ago.
Changes in the meaning of the categories in a classification threaten its integri­
ty, the principle that categories should not move within the structure of the
classification system. One way to maintain integrity while adapting to the dy­
namic and changing nature of knowledge is to define a new version of a classifi­
cation system while allowing earlier ones to persist, which preserves resource
assignments in the previous version of the classification system while allowing it
to change in the new one. If we adopt a logical perspective on classification
(§8.1.2 Classification vs. Tagging (page 393)) that dissociates the conceptual as­
signment of resources to categories from their physical arrangement, there is
no reason why a resource cannot have contrasting category assignments in dif­
ferent versions of a classification.
However, the conventional library with collections of physical resources cannot
easily abandon its requirement to use a classification to arrange books on
shelves in specific places so they can be located, checked out, and returned to
the same location.
A related principle about maintaining classifications over time is flexibility, the
degree to which the classification can accommodate new categories. Computer

8.2 Understanding Classification

407

The Discipline of Organizing

scientists typically describe this principle as extensibility, and library scientists
sometimes describe it as hospitality. In any case the concern is the same and we
are all familiar with it. When you buy a bookshelf, clothes wardrobe, file cabi­
net, or computer, it makes sense to buy one that has some extra space to accom­
modate the books, clothes, or files you will acquire over some future time frame.
As with other choices that need to be made about organizing systems, how
much extra space and “organizing room” you will acquire involves numerous
tradeoffs.
Classification schemes can increase their flexibility by creating extra “logical
space” when they are defined. Library classifications accomplish this by using
naming or numbering schemes for classification that can be extended easily to
create new subcategories. Classification schemes in information systems can al­
so anticipate the evolution of document or database schemas.481[Com]

8.2.3 Classification Is Biased
The discipline of organizing is fundamentally about choices of properties and
principles for describing and arranging resources. We discussed choices about
describing resources in §5.3 The Process of Describing Resources (page 227),
choices for creating resource categories in §7.3 Principles for Creating Catego­
ries (page 337), and choices for creating classifications in this chapter. The
choices made reflect the purposes, experiences, professions, politics, values,
and other characteristics and preferences of the people making them. As a re­
sult, every system of classification is biased because it takes a point of view that
is a composite of all of these influences.
But first we need to point out that there are at least two quite different senses
of “bias” that people reading this book are likely to encounter. The colloquial
sense of bias we discuss in this section reflects value-based decisions in organiz­
ing systems that implicitly or explicitly favor some interactions or users over
others. In contrast, statistical bias is systematic error or distortion in a meas­
urement. (See the sidebar, Statistical Bias and Variance (page 408).)
The claim that classification is biased might seem surprising, because many
classification systems are formal and institutional, created by governments or
firms participating in standards organizations. We expect these classifications to
be impartial and objective. However, consider the classification of people as
“employed” or “unemployed.” Many people think that any employable person
who is not currently employed would be counted as unemployed. But the US
government’s Department of Labor only counts someone as unemployed if they
have actively looked for work in the past month, effectively removing anyone
who has given up on finding work from the unemployed category by assigning
them to a “discouraged worker” category. In 2012 this classification scheme al­
lowed the government to report that unemployment was about 8% and falling,

408

Informatics Edition

Statistical Bias and Variance
Statistical bias is the systematic
error in measurements introduced
by miscalibration of the measure­
ment instrument, by ineffective
measurement techniques, an algo­
rithm that makes incorrect as­
sumptions, or some environment
interference, all of which distort
the measured value in a predicta­
ble way. Measurement bias con­
trasts with the variability or var­
iance of a measurement, the
amount of dispersion around an
average or expected value, most
often due to random factors.
Some variance arises because the
property being measured is not
the same for all instances, as we
would expect for measurements of
the weight of a random sample of
people, or in the set of tags or top­
ics assigned to a random sample
of news articles by people or algo­
rithms. By analyzing a large
enough set of instances it is possi­
ble to determine the most likely
values of the property and also to
estimate the amount of random
error.
High variance in the measure­
ments for a sample of resources
when we expect all of them to
have more similar values can be a
quality problem. High bias, on the
other hand, might be less of a
quality problem, because system­
atic sources of inaccuracy might
be easier to correct.

when in fact it was closer to 20% and
rising. The political implications of this
classification are substantial.482[Law]

Classification bias is often intentionally
or unintentionally shown in data visual­
izations, including choropleth maps, in
which map regions are colored, pat­
terned, or otherwise distinguished ac­
cording to a statistical variable being
displayed on the map. Choropleths are
commonly used to display election re­
sults, with the districts or states won
by each candidate shown in different colors; in the United States, the

8.2 Understanding Classification

The Discipline of Organizing

convention is to show those won by
Democratic Party candidates in blue,
and those won by Republicans in Red.
These election choropleths are often
misleading because coloring an entire
state in the winner’s colors ignores
population density and the regional
concentrations of votes that differ from
the majority. California voters are relia­
bly “blue” as a whole, but as you can
see in the nearby figure with election
results divided by county, this majority
is amassed in the large cities along the
coast, and inland and rural counties are
more reliably “red” in their voting.

California Election Map: A
“Blue” State with “Red”
Counties

A more subtle way in which choro­
pleths encode bias reflects the deci­
sions made to organize the data into
the categories that are represented by
different colors or patterns. Choropleth
categories might present data divided
into equal range intervals, into sets
with the same number of observations,
or into categories that reflect clusters
or natural breaks in the observed data. Small changes in the data ranges or pro­
portions that are then assigned to each category can communicate entirely dif­
ferent stories with the same data. To learn “how to lie with maps” or how to pre­
vent being lied to, refer to the classic book with that title by Mark Monmoni­
er.483[IA]
Friedman and Nissenbaum’s Bias In Computer Systems offers a framework for
conceptualizing the various types of bias that may be present in technical sys­
tems. Friedman and Nissenbaum define bias as “a system that systematically
and unfairly discriminates against individuals or groups of individuals in favor of
others” Their taxonomy includes pre-existing, technical, and emergent
bias.484[Com]
Pre-existing bias is the type people are most familiar with: it occurs when an or­
ganizing system’s design embodies personal or societal biases that exist at the
time of its creation, either intentionally or inadvertently, and sometimes despite
one’s best intentions to prevent it.
Technical bias arises from limitations and constraints of technical systems that
result in unfairness when the system is applied to the real world. Automated

410

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

decision-making is especially ripe for this sort of bias: alphabetical ordering,
processes that rely on pseudo-random number generation, and other automated
ways of sorting or grouping resources may systematically create different op­
portunities for different user groups (e.g., people or companies whose names
begin with “A”).
Emergent bias is related to the interplay between actual users and a technical
system. Problems of this type arise when, due to the designer's incomplete un­
derstanding of the user population, or a change in that population over time,
there is a mismatch between users and the system. User interfaces are especial­
ly susceptible to this form of bias, given their need to reflect the habits and ca­
pacities of intended users. Unfairness can emerge when an unexpected user
group uses the system, or as new societal knowledge arises that the system is
not able to incorporate or respond to.
Both pre-existing and emergent bias may be difficult to assess accurately; the
former may be difficult for the biased to see or admit to, and the latter, arising
due to unanticipated circumstances after implementation, is hard to predict.
Bowker and Star have written extensively about biases in classification systems
but acknowledge that many people do not see them:
Information scientists work every day on the design, delegation and
choice of classification systems and standards, yet few see them as arti­
facts embodying moral and aesthetic choices that in turn craft people’s
identities, aspirations and dignity.
— (Bowker and Star 2000)

Bowker and Star describe many examples where seemingly neutral and benign
classifications implement controversial assumptions. A striking example is found
in the ethnic classifications of the United States Census and the categories to
which US residents are required to assign themselves. These categories have
changed nearly every decade since the first census in 1790 and strongly reflect
political goals, prevailing cultural sensitivities or lack thereof, and non-scientific
considerations. Some recent changes included a “multi-racial” category, which
some people viewed as empowering, but which was attacked by AfricanAmerican and Hispanic civil rights groups as diluting their power.
A more positive way to think about bias in classification is that the choices made
in an organizing system about resource selection, description, and arrangement
come together to convey the values of the organizers. This makes a classifica­
tion a rhetorical or communicative vehicle for establishing credibility and trust
with those who interact with the resources in the classification. Seen in this
light, an objective or neutral classification is not only unrealistic as a goal; it
may also consume valuable time and energy when instead it might be more de­

8.2 Understanding Classification

sirable to seize the opportunity to interpret the resources in a creative way to
communicate a particular message to a particular user group. Melanie Feinberg
makes the point that “fair trade” or “green” supermarkets differentiate them­
selves by a relatively small proportion of the goods they offer compared with or­
dinary stores, but these particular items signal the values that their customers
care most about.487[Bus]
Bias is clearly evident in the most widely used bibliographic classifications, the
Library of Congress and the Dewey Decimal, which we discuss next.

8.3 Bibliographic Classification
Much of our thinking about classification comes from the bibliographic domain.
Libraries and the classification systems for the resources they contain have
been evolving for millennia, shaped by the intellectual, social, and technological
conditions of the societies that created them. As early as the third millennium
BCE, there were enough written documents—papyrus scrolls or clay tablets—
that the need arose to organize them. Some of the first attempts, by Mesopota­
mian scribes, were simple lists of documents in no particular order. The ancient
Greeks, Romans, and Chinese created more principled systems, both sorting
works by features such as language and alphabetical order, and placing them in­
to semantically significant categories such as topic or genre. Medieval Europe­
an libraries were tightly focused on Christian theology, but as secular books and
readers proliferated thanks to new technologies and increased literacy, biblio­
graphic classifications grew broader and more complex to accommodate them.
Modern classification systems are highly nuanced systems designed to encom­
pass all knowledge; however, they retain some of the same features and biases
of their forebears.
We will briefly describe the most important systems for bibliographic classifica­
tion, especially the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress
Classification (LCC) systems. However, there are several important ways in
which bibliographic classification is distinctive and we will discuss those first:
Scale, Complexity, and Degree of Standardization:
Department stores and supermarkets typically offer tens of thousands of dif­
ferent items (as measured by the number of “stock keeping units” or SKUs),
and popular online commerce sites like Amazon.com and eBay are of similar
scale. However, the standard product classification system for supermarkets
has only about 300 categories.489[Bus] The classifications for online stores are
typically deeper than those for physical stores, but they are highly idiosyn­
cratic and non-standard. In contrast, scores of university libraries have five
million or more distinct items in their collections, and they almost all use the
same standard bibliographic classification system that has about 300,000
distinct categories.

412

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

Legacy of Physical Arrangement, User Access, and Re-Shelving:
A corollary to the previous one that distinguishes bibliographic classification
systems is that they have long been shaped and continue to be shaped by
the legacy of physical arrangement, user access to the storage locations,
and re-shelving that they support. These requirements constrain the evolu­
tion and extensibility of bibliographic classifications, making them less able
to keep pace with changing concepts and new bodies of knowledge. Amazon
classifies the products it sells in huge warehouses, but its customers do not
have to pick out their purchases there, and most goods never return to the
warehouse. Amazon can add new product categories and manage the re­
sources in warehouses far more easily than libraries can.
With digital libraries, constraints of scale and physical arrangement are sub­
stantially eliminated, because the storage location is hidden from the user
and the resources do not need to be returned and re-shelved. However,
when users can search the entire content of the library, as they have learned
to expect from the web, they are less likely to use the bibliographic classifi­
cation systems that have painstakingly been applied to the library’s resour­
ces.

8.3.1 The Dewey Decimal Classification
The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) is the world’s most widely used biblio­
graphic system, applied to books in over 200,000 libraries in 135 countries. It is
a proprietary and de facto standard, and it must be licensed for use from the
Online Computer Library Center (OCLC).
In 1876, Melvil Dewey invented the DDC when he was hired to manage the Am­
herst College library immediately after graduating. Dewey was inspired by Ba­
con’s attempt to create a universal classification for all knowledge and consid­
ered the DDC as a numerical overlay on Bacon with 10 main classes, each divi­
ded into 10 more, and so on. Despite his explicit rejection of literary warrant,
however, Dewey’s classification was strongly influenced by the existing Amherst
collection, which reflected Amherst’s focus on the time on the “education of in­
digent young men of piety and talents for the Christian ministry.”
The resulting nineteenth-century Western bias in the DDC’s classification of reli­
gion seems almost startling today, where it persists in the 23rd revision (see Fig­
ure 8.2, “Religion” in Dewey Decimal Classification.). “Religion” is one of the 10
main classes, the 200 class, with nine subclasses, Six of these nine subclasses
are topics with “Christian” in the name; one class is for the Bible alone; and an­
other section is entitled “Natural theology.” Everything else related to the
world’s many religions is lumped under 290, “Other religions.”
The notational simplicity of a decimal system makes the DDC easy to use and
easy to subdivide existing categories, So-called subdivision tables allow facets

for language, geography or format to be added to many classes, making the
classification more specific. But the overall system is not very hospitable to new
areas of knowledge.

8.3.2 The Library of Congress Classification
The US Library of Congress is the largest library in the world today, but it got
off to a bad start after being established in 1800. In 1814, during the War of
1812, British troops burned down the US Capitol building where the library was
located and the 3000 books in the collection went up in flames.493[CogSci] The li­
brary was restarted a year later when Congress purchased the personal library
of former president Thomas Jefferson, which was over twice the size of the col­
lection that the British burned. Jefferson was a deeply intellectual person, and
unlike the narrow historical and legal collection of the original library, Jeffer­
son’s library reflected his “comprehensive interests in philosophy, history, geog­
raphy, science, and literature, as well as political and legal treatises.”
Restarting the Library of Congress around Jefferson’s personal collection and
classification had an interesting implication. When Herbert Putnam formally
created the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) in 1897, he meant it not as
a way to organize all the world’s knowledge, but to provide a practical way to
organize and later locate items within the Library of Congress’s collection. How­
ever, despite Putnam’s commitment to literary warrant, the breadth of Jeffer­
son’s collection made the LCC more intellectually ambitious than it might other­
wise had been, and probably contributed to its dominant adoption in university
libraries.
The LCC has 21 top-level categories, identified by letters instead of using num­
bers like the DDC (see Figure 8.3, Top Level Categories in the Library of Congress
Classification.). Each top-level category is divided into about 10-20 subclasses,
each of which is further subdivided. The complete LCC and supporting informa­
tion takes up 41 printed volumes.

Bias is apparent in the LCC as it is in the DDC, but is somewhat more subtle. A
library for the US emphasizes its own history. “Naval science” was vastly more
important in the 1800s when it was given its own top level category, separated
from other resources about “Military science” (which had a subclass for “Caval­
ry”).
The LCC is highly enumerative, and along with the uniqueness principle, this
creates distortions over time and sometimes requires contortions to incorporate
new disciplines. For example, it might seem odd today that a discipline as broad
and important as computer science does not have its own second level category
under the Q category of science, but because computer science was first taught
in math departments, the LCC has it as the QA76 subclass of mathematics,
which is QA.496[CogSci]

8.3.3 The BISAC Classification
A very different approach to bibliographic classification is represented in the
Book Industry Standards Advisory Committee classification (BISAC). BISAC is
developed by the Book Industry Study Group (BISG), a non-profit industry asso­
ciation that “develops, maintains, and promotes standards and best practices

that enable the book industry to conduct business more efficiently.” The BISAC
classification system is used by many of the major businesses within the North
American book industry, including Amazon, Baker & Taylor, Barnes & Noble,
Bookscan, Booksense, Bowker, Indigo, Ingram and most major publishers.497[Bus]
The BISAC classifications are used by publishers to suggest to booksellers how
a book should be classified in physical and online bookstores. Because of its
commercial and consumer focus, BISAC follows a principle of use warrant, and
its categories are biased toward common language usage and popular culture.
Some top-level BISAC categories, including Law, Medicine, Music, and Philoso­
phy, are also top-level categories in the LCC. However, BISAC also has top-level
categories for Comics & Graphic Novels. Cooking, Pets, and True Crime.
The differences between BISAC and the LCC are understandable because they
are used for completely different purposes and generally have little need to
come into contact. This changed in 2004, when Google began its ambitious
project to digitize the majority of the world’s books. (See the sidebar, What Is a
Library? (page 39)). To the dismay of many people in the library and academic
community, Google initially classified books using BISAC rather than the
LCC.498[Bus]
In addition, some new public libraries have adopted BISAC rather than the DDC
because they feel the former makes the library friendlier to its users. Some li­
brarians believe that their online catalogs need to be more like web search en­
gines, so a less precise classification that uses more familiar category terms
seems like a good choice.

8.4 Faceted Classification
We have noted several times that strictly enumerative classifications constrain
how resources are assigned to categories and how the classification can evolve
over time. Faceted classifications are an alternative that overcome some of
these limitations. In a faceted classification system, each resource is described
using properties from multiple facets, but a person searching for resources does
not need to consider all of the properties (and consequently the facets) and does
not need to consider them in a fixed order, which an enumerative hierarchical
classification requires.
Faceted classifications are especially useful in web user interfaces for online
shopping or for browsing a large and heterogeneous museum collection. The
process of considering facets in any order and ignoring those that are not rele­
vant implies a dynamic organizational structure that makes selection both flexi­
ble and efficient. We can best illustrate these advantages with a shopping exam­
ple in a domain that we are familiar with from §7.3.3.

416

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

If a department store offers shirts in various styles, colors, sizes, brands, and
prices, shoppers might want to search and sort through them using properties
from these facets in any order. However, in a physical store, this is not possible
because the shirts must be arranged in actual locations in the store, with dress
shirts in one area, work shirts in another, and so on.
Assume that the shirt store has shirts in four styles: dress shirts, work shirts,
party shirts, and athletic shirts. The dress shirts come in white and blue, the
work shirts in white and brown, and the party and athletic shirts come in white,
blue, brown, and red. White dress shirts come in large and medium sizes.
Suppose we are looking for a white dress shirt in a large size. We can think of
this desired shirt in two equivalent ways, either as a member of a category of
“large white dress shirts” or a shirt with “dress,” “white,” and “large” values on
style, color, and size facets. Because of the way the shirts are arranged in the
physical store, our search process has to follow a hierarchical structure of cate­
gories. We go to the dress shirt section, find white shirts, and then look for a
large one. This process corresponds to the hierarchy shown in Figure 8.4, Enu­
merative Classification with Style Facet Followed by Color Facet.
Although unlikely, a store might choose to organize its shirts by color. In our
search for a “white dress shirt in a large size,” if we consider the color first, be­
cause shirts come in four colors, there are four color categories to choose from.
When we choose the white shirts, there is no category for work shirts because
there are no work shirts that come in white. We then choose the dress shirts,
and then finally find the large one. (Figure 8.5, Enumerative Classification with
Color Facet Followed by Style Facet.)
This department store example shows that for a physical organization, one prop­
erty facet guides the localization of resources; all other facets are subordinated
under the primary organizing property. In hierarchical enumerative classifica­
tions, this means that the primary organizing facet determines the primary form
of access. The shirts are either organized by style and then color, or by color
then style, which enforces an inflexible query strategy (style first or color first).
In an online store, however, descriptions of the shirts are being searched and
sorted instead of the real shirts, and different organizations are possible. When
the shirts are described using a faceted classification system, we treat all facets
independently (i.e., they can all be the primary facet).
We can enumerate all the properties needed to assign resources appropriately,
but we create the categories (i.e., union of properties from different facets) only
as needed to sort resources with a particular combination of properties.
An additional aspect of the flexibility of faceted classification is that a facet can
be left out of a resource description if it is not needed or appropriate. For exam­
ple, because party shirts are often multi-colored with exotic patterns, it is not

In an enumerative classification system the order of the facets determines the
classification hierarchy. For example, a store might classify shirts first using a
style facet, next with a color facet, and finally with a size facet. This ordering
could result in two piles of dress shirts, one blue and one white, in which each
pile contains shirts of large and medium sizes.

that useful to describe their color. Likewise, certain types of athletic shirts
might be very loose-fitting, and as a result not be given a size description, but
their color is important because it is tied to a particular team. Figure 8.6, Face­
ted Classification. shows how these two resource types can be classified with the
faceted Shirt classification. Resource 1 describes a party shirt in medium; re­
source 2 describes an athletic shirt in blue without information about size.
A faceted classification scheme like that shown in Figure 8.6, Faceted Classifica­
tion. eliminates the requirement for predetermining a combination and ordering
of facets like those in Figure 8.4, Enumerative Classification with Style Facet

An alternative ordering of the same shirt facets changes the classification hier­

when you begin shopping which facets are important to you (“show me all the
medium party shirts,” “show me the blue athletic shirts”) instead of having to
adhere to whatever predetermined (pre-combined) enumerative classification
the store invented. In a digital organizing system, faceted classification enables
highly flexible access because prioritizing different facets can dynamically reor­
ganize how the collection is presented.

Figure 8.6. Faceted Classification.

In a pure faceted classification, not every facet needs to apply to every resource,
and there is no requirement for a predetermined order in which the facets are
considered.

8.4.1 Foundations for Faceted Classification
In library and information science texts it is common to credit the idea of face­
ted classification to S.R. Ranganathan, a Hindu mathematician working as a li­
brarian. Ranganathan had an almost mystical motivation to classify everything
in the universe with a single classification system and notation, considering it
his dharma (the closest translation in English would be “fundamental duty” or
“destiny”). Facing the limitations of Dewey’s system, where an item’s essence
had to first be identified and then the item assigned to a category based on that
essence, Ranganathan believed that all bibliographic resources could be organ­
ized around a more abstract variety of aspects.
420

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

In 1933 Ranganathan proposed that a set of five facets applied to all knowledge:
Personality
The type of thing.
Matter
The constituent material of the thing.
Energy
The action or activity of the thing.
Space
Where the thing occurs.
Time
When the thing occurs.
This classification system is known as colon classification (or PMEST) because
the notation used for resource identifiers uses a colon to separate the values on
each facet. These values come from tables of categories and subcategories,
making the call number very compact. Colon classification is most commonly
used in libraries in India.
Ranganathan deserves credit for implementing the first faceted classification
system, but people other than librarians generally credit the idea to Nicolas de
Condorcet, a French mathematician and philosopher. About 140 years before
Ranganathan, Condorcet was concerned that “systems of classification that im­
posed a given interpretation upon Nature... represented an insufferable obsta­
cle to... scientific advance.” Condorcet thus proposed a flexible classification
scheme for “arranging a large number of subjects in a system so that we may
straightway grasp their relations, quickly perceive their combinations, and read­
ily form new combinations.”502[Bus]
Faceted classification is most commonly used in narrow domains, each with its
own specific facets. This makes intuitive sense because even if resources can be
distinguished with a general classification, doing so requires lengthy notations,
and it is much harder to add to a general classification than to a classification
created specifically for a single subject area. We could probably describe shirts
using the PMEST facets, but style, color, and size seem more natural.

8.4.2 Faceted Classification in Description
Elaine Svenonius defines facets as “groupings of terms obtained by the first di­
vision of a subject discipline into homogeneous or semantically cohesive catego­
ries.” The relationships between these facets results in a controlled vocabulary
(§4.1.2) governing the resources we are organizing. From this controlled vo­
cabulary we can generate many descriptions that are complex but formally
structured, enabling us to describe things for which terms do not yet exist.
8.4 Faceted Classification

421

The Discipline of Organizing

Getty’s Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) is a robust and widely used control­
led vocabulary consisting of generic terms to describe artifacts, objects, places
and concepts in the domains of “art, architecture, and material culture.”
AAT is a thesaurus with a faceted hierarchical structure. The AAT’s facets are
“conceptually organized in a scheme that proceeds from abstract concepts to
concrete, physical artifacts:”
Associated Concepts
Concepts, philosophical and critical theory, and phenomena, such as “love”
and “nihilism.”
Physical Attributes
Material characteristics that can be measured and perceived, like “height”
and “flexibility.”
Styles and Periods
Artistic and architectural eras and stylistic groupings, such as “Renais­
sance” and “Dada.”
Agents
Basically, people and the various groups and organizations with which they
identify, whether based on physical, mental, socio-economic, or political
characteristics—e.g., “stonemasons” or “socialists.”
Activities
Actions, processes, and occurrences, such as “body painting” and “drawing.”
These are different from the “Objects” facet, which may also contain “body
painting,” in terms of the actual work itself, not the creation process.
Materials
Concerned with the actual substance of which a work is made, like “metal”
or “bleach.” “Materials” differ from “Physical Attributes” in that the latter is
more abstract than the former.
Objects
The largest facet, objects contains the actual works, like “sandcastles” and
“screen prints.”
Within each facet is a strict hierarchical structure drilling down from broad
term to very specific instance.

to understand and adapt to the way things are organized for the purpose of find­
ing them.

8.4 Faceted Classification

423

The Discipline of Organizing

8.4.3 A Classification for Facets
There are four major types of facets.
Enumerative facets
Have mutually exclusive possible values. In our online shirt store, “Style” is
an enumerative facet whose values are “dress,” “work,” “party,” and “athlet­
ic.”
Boolean facets
Take on one of two values, yes (true) or no (false) along some dimension or
property. On a sportswear website, “Waterproof” would be a Boolean facet
because an item of clothing is either waterproof or it is not.
Hierarchical facets
Organize resources by logical inclusion (§6.3.1.1). At Williams-Sonoma’s
website, the top-level facet includes “Cookware,” “Cooks’ Tools,” and “Cut­
lery.” At wine.com the “Region” facet has values for “US,” “Old World,” and
“New World,” each of which is further divided geographically. 508[CogSci] Also
see taxonomic facets.
Spectrum facets
Assume a range of numerical values with a defined minimum and maximum.
Price and date are common spectrum facets. The ranges are often modeled
as mutually exclusive regions (potential price facet values might include “$0
—$49,” “$50—$99,” and “$100—$149”).

8.4.4 Designing a Faceted Classification System
It is important to be systematic and principled when designing a faceted classifi­
cation. In some respects the process and design concerns overlap with those for
describing resources, and much of the advice in §5.3 The Process of Describing
Resources (page 227) is relevant here.

8.4.4.1 Design Process for Faceted Classification
We advocate a five step process for designing a faceted classification system.
1. Define the purposes of the classification (§5.3.2 Determining the Purposes
(page 234), §8.2.1 Classification Is Purposeful (page 400)) and specify the col­
lection of concepts or resources to be classified.
2. For each facet, determine its logical type (§8.4.3 A Classification for Facets
(page 424)) and possible values. Specify the order of the values for each fac­
et so that they make sense to users; useful orderings are alphabetical, chro­
nological, procedural, size, most popular to least popular, simple to complex,
and geographical or topological.
424

Chapter 8 — Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories

Informatics Edition

3. Analyze and describe a representative sample of resource instances to iden­
tify properties or dimensions as candidate facets (See §5.3.3 Identifying
Properties (page 241)).
4. Examine the relationships between the facets to create sub-facets if necessa­
ry. Determine how the facets will be combined to generate the classifica­
tions.
5. Test the classification on new instances, and revise the facets, facet values,
and facet grammar as needed.

8.4.4.2 Design Principles and Pragmatics
Here is some more specific advice about selecting and designing facets and fac­
et values:
Orthogonality
Facets should be independent dimensions, so a resource can have values of
all of them while only having one value on each of them. In an online kitchen
store, one facet might be “Product” and another might be “Brand.” A partic­
ular item might be classified as a “Saucepan” in the “Product” facet and as
“Calphalon” in the “Brand” one. Other saucepans might have other brands,
and other Calphalon products might not be saucepans, because Product and
Brand are orthogonal.
Semantic Balance
Top-level facets should be the properties that best differentiate the resour­
ces in the classification domain. The values should be of equal semantic
scope so that resources are distributed among the subcategories. Subfacets
of “Cookware” like “Sauciers and Saucepans” and “Roasters and Brasiers”
are semantically balanced as they are both named and grouped by cooking
activity.510[Ling]
Coverage
The values of a facet should be able of classifying all instances within the in­
tended scope.
Scalability
Facet values must accommodate potential additions to the set of instances.
Including an “Other” value is an easy way to ensure that a facet is flexible
and hospitable to new instances, but it not desirable if all new instances will
be assigned that value.
Objectivity
Although every classification has an explicit or implicit bias (§8.2.3 Classifi­
cation Is Biased (page 408)), facets and facet values should be as unambigu­
ous and concrete as possible to enable reliable classification of instances.
8.4 Faceted Classification

425

The Discipline of Organizing

Normativity
To make a faceted classification as useful by as many people as possible, the
terms used for facets and facet values should not be idiosyncratic, meta­
phorical, or require special knowledge to interpret.511[CogSci]
As we will see in §8.6 Computational Classification (page 427), classification can
sometimes be done by computers rather than by people. Computer algorithms
can analyze resource properties and descriptions to identify dimensions on
which resources differ and the most frequent descriptive terms, which can then
be used to design a faceted classification scheme. Resources can then be as­
signed to the appropriate categories, either without human intervention or in
collaboration with a human who trains the algorithm with classified instances.

8.5 Classification by Activity Structure
Institutional classification systems are often strongly hierarchical and taxonom­
ic because their many users come to them for diverse purposes, making a
context-free or semantic organization the most appropriate. However, in narrow
domains that offer a more limited variety of uses it can be much more effective
to classify resources according to the tasks or activities they support. A task or
activity-based classification system is called a taskonomy, a term invented by
anthropologists Janet Dougherty and Charles Keller after their ethnographic
study of how blacksmiths organized their tools. Instead of keeping things to­
gether according to their semantic relationships in what Donald Norman called
“hardware store organization,” the blacksmiths arranged tools in locations
where they were used— “fire tools,” “stump tools,” “drill press rack tools,” and
so on.512[CogSci]
Personal organizing systems are often taskonomic. Think about the way you
cook when you are following a recipe. Do you first retrieve all the ingredients
from their storage places, and arrange them in activity-based groups in the
preparation area?513[CogSci]
Looking at the relationship between tasks and tools in this way can help a cook
determine the best way to organize tools in a kitchen. Cutting items would nec­
essarily be kept together near a prep area; having to run across the kitchen to
another area where a poultry knife is kept with, say, chicken broth would be det­
rimental to the cook’s workflow. It would make far more sense to have all of the
items for the task of cutting in a single area.

Classification

Think about your personal office
space. It may be an interesting hy­
brid space—it probably contains
documents that could be classified
in a hierarchical system, but it is al­
so a work space that could lend it­
self to “taskonomy” organization.
Which does it more closely resem­
ble? How have any conflicts be­
tween hierarchy and “taskonomy”
been resolved?

Because of its importance, ubiquity,
and ease of processing by computers,
it should not be surprising that a
great many computational classifica­
tion problems involve text. Some of
these problems are relatively simple,
like identifying the language in which
a text is written, which is solved by
comparing the probability of one, two,
and three character-long contiguous
strings in the text against their proba­
bilities in different languages. For ex­
ample, in English the most likely strings are “the”, “and”, “to”, “of”, “a”, “in”,
and so on. But if the most likely strings are “der”, “die”, “und”, and “den” the
text is German and if they are “de”, “la”, “que”, “el”, and “en” the text is Span­
ish.
More challenging text classification problems arise when more features are re­
quired to describe each instance being classified and where the features are
less predictable. The unknown author of a document can sometimes be identi­
fied by analyzing other documents known to be written by him to identify a set
of features like word frequency, phrase structure, and sentence length that cre­
ate a “writeprint” analogous to a fingerprint that uniquely identifies him. This
kind of analysis was used in 2013 to determine that Harry Potter author J. K.
Rowling had written a crime fiction novel entitled The Cuckoo's Calling under
the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.514[Com]
Another challenging text classification problem is sentiment analysis, determin­
ing whether a text has a positive or negative opinion about some topic. Much

academic and commercial research has been conducted to understand the senti­
ment of Twitter tweets, Facebook posts, email sent to customer support applica­
tions, and other similar contexts. Sentiment analysis is hard because messages
are often short so there is not much to analyze, and because and because sar­
casm, slang, clichés, and cultural norms obscure the content needed to make
the classification.
A crucial consideration whenever supervised learning is used to train a classifi­
er is ensuring that the training set is appropriate. If we were training a classifi­
er to detect spam messages using email from the year 2000, the topics of the
emails, the words they contain, and perhaps even the language they are written
in would be substantially different than messages from this year. Up to date
training data is especially important for the classification algorithms used by
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and similar social sites that classify and recom­
mend content based on popularity trends.
When the relevant training data is constantly changing and there is a great deal
of it, there is a risk that by the time a model can learn to classify correctly it is
already out of date. This challenge has led to the development of streaming al­
gorithms that operate on data as it comes in, using it as a live data source rath­
er than as a static training set. Streaming algorithms are essential for tackling
datasets that are too large to store or for models that must operate under in­
tense time pressure. Streaming approaches complement rather than replace
those that work with historical datasets because they make different tradeoffs
between accuracy and speed. The streaming system might provide real-time
alerting and recommendations, while historical analyses are made on the batchoriented system that works with the entire data collection.515[Com]
How

“learns” depends on the specific ma­
chine learning algorithm. Decision

machines, and neural net approaches

Sometimes, a text message might

not. Is the customer happy if he

Think of some other short messages

timent analysis difficult. How would
you write a product or service re­

tive, negative, or neutral? How
would you write a review whose

8.7 Key Points in Chapter Eight
• Classification is the systematic assignment of resources to a system of inten­
tional categories, often institutional ones.
(See §8.1 Introduction (page 391))
• A classification system is foremost a specification for the logical arrange­
ment of resources because there are usually many possible and often arbi­
trary mappings of logical locations to physical ones.
(See §8.1.3 Classification vs. Physical Arrangement (page 395))
• A classification creates structure in the organizing system that increases the
variety and capability of the interactions it can support.
(See §8.2.1.2 Classifications Support Interactions (page 401))
• Classifications are always biased by the purposes, experiences, professions,
politics, values, and other characteristics and preferences of the people
making them.
(See §8.2.3 Classification Is Biased (page 408))
• Three types of bias in technical systems are pre-existing, technical, and
emergent bias.
(See §8.2.3 Classification Is Biased (page 408))
• Classification schemes in which all possible categories to which resources
can be assigned are defined explicitly are called enumerative.
(See §8.1.4 Classification Schemes (page 395))
• When multiple resource properties are considered in a fixed sequence, each
property creates another level in the system of categories and the classifica­
tion scheme is hierarchical or taxonomic.
(See §8.1.4 Classification Schemes (page 395))
• Classification and standardization are not identical, but they are closely rela­
ted. Some classifications become standards, and some standards define new
classifications.
(See §8.1.5 Classification and Standardization (page 397))
• A standard is a published specification that is developed and maintained by
consensus of all the relevant stakeholders in some domain by following a de­
fined and transparent process.

• Standard semantics are especially important in industries or markets that
have significant network effects where the value of a product depends on
the number of interoperable or compatible products.
(See §8.1.5.2 Institutional Semantics (page 397))
• The principle of literary warrant holds that a classification must be based
only on the specific resources that are being classified.
(See §8.2.2.1 Principles Embodied in the Classification Scheme (page 404))
• The uniqueness principle means the categories in a classification scheme
are mutually exclusive. Thus, when a logical concept is assigned to a partic­
ular category, it cannot simultaneously be assigned to another category.
(See §8.2.2.2 Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories (page 405))
• The general solution to satisfying the uniqueness principle in library classifi­
cations when resources do not clearly fit in a single category is to invent and
follow a detailed set of often-arbitrary rules.

• Categories sometimes change slowly, but they can also change quickly and
radically as a result of technological, process, or geopolitical innovation or
events.
(See §8.2.2.3 Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time (page

• Flexibility, extensibility, and hospitality are synonyms for the degree to
which the classification can accommodate new resources.
(See §8.2.2.3 Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time (page

• Bibliographic classification is distinctive because of a legacy of physical ar­
rangement and its scale and complexity.
(See §8.3 Bibliographic Classification (page 412))
• Faceted classification systems enumerate all the categories needed to assign
resources appropriately, but instead of combining them in advance in a fixed
hierarchy, they are applied only if they are needed to sort resources with a
particular combination of properties.
(See §8.4 Faceted Classification (page 416))
• Facets should be independent dimensions, so a resource can have values of
all of them while only having one value on each of them.
(See §8.4.4.2 Design Principles and Pragmatics (page 425))
• Top-level facets should be the properties that best differentiate the resour­
ces in the classification domain. The values should be of equal semantic

scope so that resources are distributed among the subcategories. Subfacets
of “Cookware” like “Sauciers and Saucepans” and “Roasters and Brasiers”
are semantically balanced as they are both named and grouped by cooking
activity.
(See §8.4.4.2 Design Principles and Pragmatics (page 425))
• Facet values must accommodate potential additions to the set of instances.
Including an “Other” value is an easy way to ensure that a facet is flexible
and hospitable to new instances, but it not desirable if all new instances will
be assigned that value.
(See §8.4.4.2 Design Principles and Pragmatics (page 425))
• Most tagging seems insufficiently principled to be considered classification,
except when tags are treated as category labels or when decisions that
make tagging more systematic turn a set of tags into a tagsonomy.

The Discipline of Organizing

The most “standard” of all standards organization is the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO), whose members are themselves nation­
al standards organizations, which as a result gives the nearly 20,000 ISO stand­
ards the broadest and most global coverage. See http://ISO.org. In addition,
there are scores of other national and industry-specific standards bodies whose
work is potentially relevant to organizing systems of the sorts discussed in this
book. We encounter these kinds of standards every day in codes for countries,
currencies, and airports, in file formats, in product barcodes, and in many other
contexts.

[463][Bus]

A small number of people can often informally agree on an organizing
system that meets the needs of each participant. But each new person often
brings new requirements and it is not feasible to resolve every disagreement be­
tween every pair of participants. Instead, for a large-scale organizing system,
decisions are usually made by entities that have the authority to coordinate ac­
tions and prevent conflicts by imposing a single solution on all the participants.
(Rosenthal, Seligman, and Renner 2004) call this the “person-concept” tradeoff,
which we can paraphrase as “a few people can agree on a lot, but a lot of people
can only agree on a little.”
[464][Bus]

This authority can come from many different sources, but they can be roughly
categorized as “authority from power” and “authority from consensus.” Often
the economic dominance of a firm allows it to control how business gets done in
its industry. One key part of that is establishing specifications for data formats
and classification schemes in organizing systems, which usually means requir­
ing other firms to use the ones developed by the dominant firm for its own use.
This ensures the continued efficiency of their own business processes while
making it harder for other firms to challenge their market power.
In contrast, consensus is the authority mechanism embodied in the workings of
the open source community, where the freedom to view and change data for­
mats and code that uses them encourages cooperation and adoption. Consensus
also underlies the authority of voluntary standards activities, where firms work
together under the auspices of a standards body and agree to follow its proce­
dures for creating, ratifying, and implementing standards.
International and national standards bodies derive their authority from
the authority of the governments that created them. But standards organiza­
tions arguably derive most of their authority from the collective power of their
members, because many influential standards organizations like OASIS, W3C,
OMG, and IETF are not chartered or sponsored by governments. In addition,
firms often create ad hoc “quasi-standards” organizations or “communities of in­

terest” to facilitate relatively short-term cooperative standards-making activities
that in the former case would otherwise be prohibited by anti-trust considera­
tions. Finally, at the extreme “lightweight” end of the standards-making continu­
um, the codification of simple and commonly used information models as “mi­
croformats” depends on authority that emerges from the collaboration of indi­
viduals rather than firms.
Often a standard evolves from an existing specification submitted to a
standards organization by the firm that created it. In other cases, the specifica­
tions used by a dominant firm becomes a de facto standard by other firms in its
industry, and it is never submitted to a formal standards-making process.

See (Shapiro and Varian, 1998).

Governments have inherently long time horizons for their actions, they
need to serve all citizens fairly and without discrimination, and they (should
seek to) minimize cost to taxpayers. Each of these principles is an independent
argument for standards and taken together they make a very strong one. In­
deed, one the founding goals in the US Constitution is to protect the public in­
terest, and this is enabled in Article I, Section 8 by granting Congress the power
to set standards “of Weights and Measures” to facilitate commerce. Setting
standards is a key role of the National Institute of Standards and Technolo­
gy (NIST), part of the Department of Commerce, and other departments have
similar standards-setting responsibilities and agencies, like the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in the Department of Health and Social Services. In addi­
tion, independent government agencies like the Federal Communications Com­
mission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) set numerous standards
that are relevant to information organizing systems. And of course, the Library
of Congress (LOC) maintains procedures and standards needed “to sustain and
preserve a universal collection of knowledge... for future generations”
(LOC.gov/about).

That was not a typo. The “War of 1812” lasted well into 1815. The per­
sistence of an inaccurate name for this war reflects its unique characteristics.
Wars (in the English language) are generally named for the location of the fight­
ing or the enemy being fought (the Mexican-American War, the Korean War, the
Vietnam War, the Iraq War), or for a particular ideal or ambition (the Revolution­
ary War, the Civil War). The War of 1812 does not satisfy any of these naming
conventions; the war was fought across a huge range of geography from eastern
Canada to Louisiana, between a diverse range of groups from Canadians and
Native American tribes, with national armies getting involved very late in the
war. While nominally fought over freedom the seas, the war quickly morphed in­
to one about territorial ambition in North America. Of course, if the world were
a place where people could agree on naming standards for wars, it is likely we

9.1 Introduction
Throughout this book, we have emphasized the importance of separately consid­
ering fundamental organizing principles, application-specific concepts, and de­
tails of implementation. The three-tier architecture we introduced in §1.6 is one
way to conceptualize this separation. In §6.7, we contrasted the
implementation-focused perspective for analyzing relationships with other per­
spectives that focus on the meaning and abstract structure of relationships. In
this chapter, we present this contrast between conceptualization and implemen­
tation in terms of separating the content and form of resource descriptions.
In the previous chapters, we have considered principles and concepts of organ­
izing in many different contexts, ranging from personal organizing systems to
cultural and institutional ones. We have noted that some organizing systems
have limited scope and expected lifetime, such as a task-oriented personal or­
ganizing system like a shopping list. Other organizing systems support broad
uses that rely on standard categories developed through rigorous processes,
like a product catalog.
By this point you should have a good sense of the various conceptual issues you
need to consider when deciding how to describe a resource in order to meet the

The Discipline of Organizing

goals of your organizing system. Considering those issues will give you some
sense of what the content of your descriptions should be. In order to focus on
the conceptual issues, we have deferred discussion of specific implementation
issues. Implementation involves choosing the specific form of your descriptions,
and that is the topic of this chapter.
We can approach the problem of how to form resource descriptions from two
perspectives: structuring and writing. From one perspective, resource descrip­
tions are things that are used by both people and computational agents. From
this perspective, choosing the form of resource descriptions is a kind of design.
This is easy to see for certain kinds of resource descriptions, notably signs and
maps found in physical environments like airport terminals, public libraries, and
malls. In these spaces, resource descriptions are quite literally designed to help
people orient themselves and find their way. But any kind of resource descrip­
tion, not just those embedded in the built environment, can be viewed as a de­
signed object. Designing an object involves making decisions about how it
should be structured so that it can best be used for its intended purpose. From
a design perspective, choosing the form of a resource description means making
decisions about its structure.
In §6.5, we took a structural perspective on resources and the relationships
among them. In this chapter, we will take a structural perspective on resource
descriptions. The difference is subtle but important. A structural perspective on
resource relationships focuses on how people or computational processes asso­
ciate, arrange, and connect those resources. A structural perspective on re­
source descriptions focuses on how those associations, arrangements, and con­
nections are explicitly represented or implemented in the descriptions we cre­
ate. Mismatches between the structure imposed on the resources being organ­
ized and the structure of the descriptions used to implement that organization
could result in an organizing system that is complex, inefficient, and difficult to
maintain, as you will see in our first example (Example 9.1, Description struc­
tured as a dictionary).
The structures of resource descriptions enable or inhibit particular ways of in­
teracting with those descriptions, just as the descriptions themselves enable or
inhibit particular ways of interacting with the described resources. (See
§3.4 Designing Resource-based Interactions (page 122), and Chapter 10, Interac­
tions with Resources) Keep in mind that resource descriptions are themselves
information resources, so much of what we will say in this chapter is applicable
to the structures and forms of information resources in general. Put another
way, the structure and form of information resources informs the design of re­
source descriptions.
From another perspective, creating resource descriptions is a kind of writing. I
may describe something to you orally, but such a description might not be very

438

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

useful to an organizing system unless it were transcribed. Organizing systems
need persistent descriptions, and that means they need to be written. In that
sense, choosing the form of a resource description means making decisions
about notation and syntax.
Modern Western culture tends to make a sharp distinction between designing
and writing, but there are areas where this distinction breaks down, and the
creation of resource descriptions in organizing systems is one of them. In the
following sections, we will use designing and writing as two lenses for looking
at the problem of how to choose the form of resource descriptions. Specifically,
we will examine the spectrum of options we have for structuring descriptions,
and the kinds of syntaxes we have for writing those descriptions.

9.2 Structuring Descriptions
Choosing how to structure resource descriptions is a matter of making princi­
pled and purposeful design decisions in order to solve specific problems, serve
specific purposes, or bring about some desirable property in the descriptions.
Most of these decisions are specific to a domain: the particular context of appli­
cation for the organizing system being designed and the kinds of interactions
with resources it will enable. Making these kinds of context-specific decisions
results in a model of that domain. (See §5.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Descrip­
tion (page 232).)
Over time, many people have built similar kinds of descriptions. They have had
similar purposes, desired similar properties, and faced similar problems. Unsur­
prisingly, they have converged on some of the same decisions. When common
sets of design decisions can be identified that are not specific to any one do­
main, they often become systematized in textbooks and in design practices, and
may eventually be designed into standard formats and architectures for creat­
ing organizing systems. These formally recognized sets of design decisions are
known as abstract models or metamodels. Metamodels describe structures com­
monly found in resource descriptions and other information resources, regard­
less of the specific domain. While any designer of an organizing system will usu­
ally create a model of her specific domain, she usually will not create an entirely
new metamodel but will instead make choices from among the metamodels that
have been formally recognized and incorporated into existing standards. The re­
sulting model is sometimes called a “domain-specific language.” Reusing stand­
ard metamodels can bring great economical advantages, as developers can re­
use tools designed for and knowledge about these metamodels, rather than hav­
ing to start from scratch.
In the following sections, we examine some common kinds of structures used as
the basis for metamodels. But first, we consider a concrete example of how the
structure of resource descriptions supports or inhibits particular uses. As we

explained in Chapter 1, the concept of a resource de-emphasizes the differences
between physical and digital things in favor of focusing on how things, in gener­
al, are used to support goal-oriented activity. Different kinds of books can be
treated as information resources regardless of the particular mix of tangible
and intangible properties they may have. Since resource descriptions are also
information resources, we can similarly consider how their structures support
particular uses, independent of whether they are physical, digital, or a mix of
both.
During World War II, a British chemist named W. E. Batten developed a system
for organizing patents.516[Com] The system consisted of a language for describing
the product, process, use, and apparatus of a patent, and a way of using
punched cards to record these descriptions. Batten used cards printed with ma­
trices of 800 positions (see Figure 9.1). Each card represented a specific value
from the vocabulary of the description language, and each position correspon­
ded to a particular patent. To describe patent #256 as covering extrusion of pol­
ythene to produce cable coverings, one would first select the cards for the val­

440

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

ues polythene, extrusion, and cable coverings, and then punch each card at the
256th position. The description of patent #256 would thus extend over these
three cards.
The advantage of this structure is that to find patents covering extrusion of pol­
ythene (for any purpose), one needs only to select the two cards corresponding
to those values, lay one on top of the other, and hold them up to a light. Light
will shine through wherever there is a position corresponding to a patent de­
scribed using those values. Patents meeting a certain description are easily
found due to the structure of the cards designed to describe the patents.

Punchcard Machine

Punchcards were an important informa­
tion input and storage medium for deca­
des, even before the invention of comput­
ers. The Hollerith keyboard punch was
used to transcribe the information collec­
ted in the 1890 US census. The template
being used in this photo is for recording
information about a farm. The punch
cards were tabulated by electromechani­
cal machines. A merger of four tabulating
machine companies in 1911 created a
company whose current name is IBM.

Of course, this system has clear
disadvantages as well. Finding
the concepts associated with a
particular patent is tedious, be­
cause every card must be inspec­
ted. Adding a new patent is rela­
tively easy as long as there is an
index that allows the cards for
specific concepts to be located
quickly. However, once the cards
run out of space for punching
holes, the whole set of cards must
be duplicated to accommodate
more patents: a very expensive
operation. Adding new concepts
is potentially easy: simply add a
new card. But if we want to be
able to find existing patents using
the new concept, all the existing
patents would have to be reexamined to determine whether
their positions on the new card
should be punched: also an ex­
pensive operation.

The structure of Batten’s cards
supported rapid selection of re­
sources given a partial descrip­
tion. The kinds of structures we
(Photo by R. Glushko.)
will examine in the following sec­
tions are not quite so elaborate as
Batten’s cards. But like the cards, each kind of structure supports more efficient
mechanical execution of certain operations, at the cost of less efficient execu­
tion of others.

collection of the Computer History Muse­
um in Mountain View, California.

9.2 Structuring Descriptions

441

The Discipline of Organizing

9.2.1 Kinds of Structures
Sets, lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs are kinds of structures that can be
used to form resource descriptions. As we shall see, each of these kinds is ac­
tually a family of related structures. These structures are abstractions: they de­
scribe formal structural properties in a general way, rather than specifying an
exact physical or textual form. Abstractions are useful because they help us to
see common properties shared by different specific ways of organizing informa­
tion. By focusing on these common properties, we can more easily reason about
the operations that different forms support and the affordances that they pro­
vide, without being distracted by less relevant details.

9.2.1.1 Blobs
The simplest kind of structure is no structure at all. Consider the following de­
scription of a book: Sebald’s novel uses a walking tour in East Anglia to medi­
tate on links between past and present, East and West.517[Ling] This description is
an unstructured text expression with no clearly defined internal parts, and we
can consider it to be a blob. Or, more precisely, it has structure, but that struc­
ture is the underlying grammatical structure of the English language, and none
of that grammatical structure is explicitly represented in a surface structure
when the sentence is expressed. As readers of English we can interpret the sen­
tence as a description of the subject of the book, but to do this mechanically is
difficult.518[Ling] On the other hand, such a written description is relatively easy
to create, as the describer can simply use natural language.
A blob need not be a blob of text. It could be a photograph of a resource, or a
recording of a spoken description of a resource. Like blobs of text, blobs of pix­
els or sound have underlying structure that any person with normal vision or
hearing can understand easily.519[CogSci] But we can treat these blobs as unstruc­
tured, because none of the underlying structure in the visual or auditory input is
explicit, and we are concerned with the ways that the structures of resource de­
scriptions support or inhibit mechanical or computational operations.520[Com]

9.2.1.2 Sets
The simplest way to structure a description is to give it parts and treat them as
a set. For example, the description of Sebald’s novel might be reformulated as a
set of terms: Sebald, novel, East Anglia, walking, history. Doing this has lost
much of the meaning, but something has been gained: we now can easily distin­
guish Sebald and walking as separate items in the description. This makes it
easier to find, for example, all the descriptions that include the term walking.
(Note that this is different from simply searching through blob-of-text descrip­
tions for the word walking. When treated as a set, the description Fiji, fire walk­

ing, memoir does not include the term walking, though it does include the term
fire walking.)
Sets make it easy to find intersections among descriptions. Sets are also easy to
create. In §8.1.2 we looked at “folksonomies,” organizing systems in which nonprofessional users create resource descriptions. In these systems, descriptions
are structured as sets of “tags.” To find resources, users can specify a set of
tags to obtain resources having descriptions that intersect at those tags. This is
more valuable if the tags come from a controlled vocabulary, making intersec­
tions more likely. But enforcing vocabulary control adds complexity to the de­
scription process, so a balance must be struck between maximizing potential in­
tersections and making description as simple as practical.522[Com]
A set is a type or class of structure. We can refine the definition of different
kinds of sets by introducing constraints. For example, we might introduce the
constraint that a given set has a maximum number of items. Or we might con­
strain a set to always have the same number of items, giving us a fixed-size set.
We can also remove constraints. Sets do not contain duplicate items (think of a
tagging system in which it does not make sense to assign the same tag more
than once to the same resource). If we remove this uniqueness constraint, we
have a different structure known as a “bag” or “multiset.”

9.2.1.3 Lists
Constraints are what distinguish lists from sets. A list, like a set, is a collection
of items with an additional constraint: their items are ordered. If we were de­
signing a tagging system in which it was important that the order of the tags be
maintained, we would want to use lists, not sets. Unlike sets, lists may contain
duplicate items. In a list, two items that are otherwise the same can be distin­
guished by their position in the ordering, but in a set this is not possible. For ex­
ample, we might want to organize the tags assigned to a resource, listing the
most used tag first, the least frequently used last, and the rest according to
their frequency of use.
Again, we can introduce constraints to refine the definition of different kinds of
lists, such as fixed-length lists. If we constrain a list to contain only items that
are themselves lists, and further specify that these contained lists do not them­
selves contains lists, then we have a table (a list of lists of items). A spreadsheet
is a list of lists.

9.2 Structuring Descriptions

443

The Discipline of Organizing

9.2.1.4 Dictionaries
One major limitation of lists and sets is that, although items can be individually
addressed, there is no way to distinguish the items except by comparing their
values (or, in a list, their positions in the ordering). In a set of terms like Sebald,
novel, East Anglia, walking, history, for example, one cannot easily tell that Se­
bald refers to the author of the book while East Anglia and walking refer to
what it is about. One way of addressing this problem is to break each item in a
set into two parts: a property and a value. So, for example, our simple set of
tags might become author: Sebald, type: novel, subject: East Anglia, subject:
walking, subject: history. Now we can say that author, type, and subject are the
properties, and the original items in the set are the values.
author
Sebald
type
novel
subject1
East Anglia
subject2
walking
subject3
history
This kind of structure is called a dictionary, a map or an associative array. A dic­
tionary is a set of property-value pairs or entries. It is a set of entries, not a list
of entries, because the pairs are not ordered and because each entry must have
a unique key.523[Com] Note that this specialized meaning of dictionary is different
from the more common meaning of “dictionary” as an alphabetized list of terms
accompanied by sentences that define them. The two meanings are related,
however. Like a “real” dictionary, a dictionary structure allows us to easily find
the value (such as a definition) associated with a particular property or key
(such as a word). But unlike a real dictionary, which orders its keys alphabeti­
cally, a dictionary structure does not specify an order for its keys.
Dictionaries are ubiquitous in resource descriptions. Structured descriptions en­
tered using a form are easily represented as dictionaries, where the form items'
labels are the properties and the data entered are the values. Tabular data with
a “header row” can be thought of as a set of dictionaries, where column headers
are the properties for each dictionary, and each row is a set of corresponding
values. Dictionaries are also a basic type of data structure found in nearly all
programming languages (referred to as associative arrays).

444

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

Again, we can introduce or remove constraints to define specialized types of dic­
tionaries. A sorted dictionary adds an ordering over entries; in other words, it is
a list of entries rather than a set. A multimap is a dictionary in which multiple
entries may have the same key.

9.2.1.5 Trees
In dictionaries as they are commonly understood, properties are terms and val­
ues are their corresponding definitions. The terms and values are usually words,
phrases, or other expressions that can be ordered alphabetically. But if general­
ize the notion of a dictionary as abstract sets of property-value pairs, the values
can be anything at all. In particular, the values can themselves be dictionaries.
When a dictionary structure has values that are themselves dictionaries, we say
that the dictionaries are nested. Nesting is very useful for resource descriptions
that need more structure than what a (non-nested) dictionary can provide.

Figure 9.2. Four Nested Dictionaries.

When a dictionary contains other dictionaries, they are said to be nested.

Figure 9.2, Four Nested Dictionaries. presents an example of nested dictionaries.
At the top level there is one dictionary with a single entry having the property a.
The value associated with a is a dictionary consisting of two entries, the first
having property b and the second having property c. The values associated with
b and with c are also dictionaries.
If we nest dictionaries like this, and our “top” dictionary (the one that contains
all the others) has only one entry, then we have a kind of tree structure. Fig­
ure 9.3, A Tree of Properties and Values. shows the same properties and values

9.2 Structuring Descriptions

as Figure 9.2, this time arranged to make the tree structure more visible. Trees
consist of nodes (the letters and numbers in Figure 9.3) joined by edges (the ar­
rows). Each node in the tree with a circle around it is a property, and the value
of each property consists of the nodes below (to the right of) it in the tree. A
node is referred to as the parent of the nodes below it, which in turn are refer­
red to as the children of that node. The edges show these “parent of” relation­
ships between the nodes. The node with no parent is called the root of the tree.
Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.

Figure 9.3. A Tree of Properties and Values.

An alternative representation of nested dictionaries is as a tree. The lowest level
or leaf nodes of the tree contain property values.

As with the other types of structures we have considered, we can define differ­
ent kinds of trees by introducing different types of constraints. For example, the
predominant metamodel for XML is documents is a kind of tree called the XML
Information Set or Infoset. 525[Com]
The XML Information Set defines a specific kind of tree structure by adding
very specific constraints, including ordering of child nodes, to the basic defini­
tion of a tree. The addition of an ordering constraint distinguishes XML trees
from nested dictionaries, in which child nodes do not have any order (because

446

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

dictionary entries do not have an ordering). Ordering is an important constraint
for resource descriptions, since without ordering it is impossible to, for exam­
ple, list multiple authors while guaranteeing that the order of authors will be
maintained. Figure 9.3 depicts a kind of tree with a different set of constraints:
all non-leaf nodes are properties, and all leafs are values. We could also define a
tree in which every node has both a property and a value. Trees exist in a large
variety of flavors, but they all share a common topology: the edges between no­
des are directed (one node is the parent and the other is the child), and every
node except the root has exactly one parent.
Trees provide a way to group statements describing different but related re­
sources. For example, consider the description structured as a dictionary here:

Example 9.1. Description structured as a dictionary
author given names → Winfried Georg
author surname → Sebald
title → Die Ringe des Saturn
pages → 371
The dictionary groups together four property-value pairs describing a particular
book. (The arrows are simply a schematic way to indicate property-value rela­
tions. Later in the chapter we look at ways to “write” these relations using some
specific syntax.)
But really the first two entries are not describing the book; they are describing
the book’s author. So, it would be better to group those two statements some­
how. We can do this by nesting the entries describing the author within the book
description, creating a tree structure:

Example 9.2.
description

Nesting

an

author

within

a

book

author →
given names → Winfried Georg
surname → Sebald
title → Die Ringe des Saturn
pages → 371
Using a tree works well in this case because we can treat the book as the pri­
mary resource being described, making it the root of our tree, and adding on
the author description as a “branch.”

9.2 Structuring Descriptions

447

The Discipline of Organizing

We also could have chosen to make the author the primary resource, giving us a
tree like the one in Example 9.3.

Example 9.3. Nesting book descriptions within an author description
given names → Winfried Georg
surname → Sebald
books authored →
1. title → Die Ringe des Saturn
pages → 371
2. title → Austerlitz
pages → 416
Note that in this dictionary, the value of the books authored property is a list of
dictionaries. Making the author the primary or root resource allows us to in­
clude multiple book descriptions in the tree (but makes it more difficult to de­
scribe books having multiple authors). A tree is a good choice for structuring
descriptions as long as we can clearly identify a primary resource. In some ca­
ses, however, we want to connect descriptions of related resources without hav­
ing to designate one as primary. In these cases, we need a more flexible data
structure.

9.2.1.6 Graphs
Suppose we were describing two books, where the author of one book is the
subject of the other, as in Example 9.4, Two related descriptions:

Example 9.4. Two related descriptions
1. author → Mark Richard McCulloch
title → Understanding W. G. Sebald
subject → Winfried Georg Sebald
2. author → Winfried Georg Sebald
title → Die Ringe des Saturn
By looking at these descriptions, we can guess the relationship between the two
books, but that relationship is not explicitly represented in the structure: we
just have two separate dictionaries and have inferred the relationship by match­
ing property values. It is possible that this inference could be wrong: there
might be two people named Winfried Georg Sebald. How can we structure these
descriptions to explicitly represent the fact that the Winfried Georg Sebald that
is the subject of the first book is the same Winfried Georg Sebald who authored
the second?
One possibility would be to make Winfried Georg Sebald the root of a tree, simi­
lar to the approach taken in Example 9.3, Nesting book descriptions within an
author description, adding a book about property alongside the books authored
448

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

one. This solution would work fine if people were our primary resources, and it
thus made sense to structure our descriptions around them. But suppose that
we had decided that our descriptions should be structured around books, and
that we were using a vocabulary that took this perspective (with properties such
as author and subject rather than books authored and books about). We should
not let a particular structure limit the organizational perspective we can take,
as Batten’s cards did. Instead, we should consciously choose structures to suit
our organizational perspective. How can we do this?
If we treat our two book descriptions as trees, we can join the two branches
(subject and author) that share a value. When we do this, we no longer have a
tree, because we now have a node with more than one parent (Figure 9.4, De­
scriptions Linked into a Graph.). The structure in Figure 9.4, Descriptions Linked
into a Graph. is a graph. Like a tree, a graph consists of a set of nodes connec­
ted by edges. These edges may or may not have a direction (§6.6.3 Directionality
(page 307)). If they do, the graph is referred to as a “directed graph.” If a graph
is directed, it may be possible to start at a node and follow edges in a path that
leads back to the starting node. Such a path is called a “cycle.” If a directed
graph has no cycles, it is referred to as an “acyclic graph.”
A tree is just a more constrained kind of graph. Trees are directed graphs be­
cause the “parent of” relationship between nodes is asymmetric: the edges are
arrows that point in a certain direction. (See §6.3.2.1 Symmetry (page 284).)
Furthermore, trees are acyclic graphs, because if you follow the directed edges
from one node to another, you can never encounter the same node twice. Final­
ly, trees have the constraint that every node (except the root) must have exactly
one parent.526[Com]
In Figure 9.4, Descriptions Linked into a Graph. we have violated this constraint
by joining our two book trees. The graph that results is still directed and acy­
clic, but because the Winfried George Sebald node now has two parents, it is no
longer a tree.
Graphs are very general and flexible
structures. Many kinds of systems can
be conceived of as nodes connected
by edges: stations connected by sub­
way lines, people connected by
friendships, decisions connected by
dependencies, and so on. Relation­
ships can be modeled in different
ways using different kinds of graphs.
For example, if we assume that
friendship
is
symmetric
(see
§6.3.2.1 Symmetry (page 284)), we

would use an undirected graph to model the relationship. However, in webbased social networks friendship is often asymmetric (you might “friend” some­
one who does not reciprocate), so a directed graph is more appropriate.
Often it is useful to treat a graph as a set of pairs of nodes, where each pair may
or may not be directly connected by an edge. Many approaches to characteriz­
ing structural relationships among resources (see §6.5.3 Structural Relationships
between Resources (page 300)) are based on modeling the related resources as
a set of pairs of nodes, and then analyzing patterns of connectedness among
them. As we will see, being able to break down a graph into pairs is also useful
when we structure resource descriptions as graphs.
In §9.4.1 we will use XML to model the graph shown in Figure 9.4, Descriptions
Linked into a Graph. by using “references” to connect a book to its title, authors
and subject. This will allow us to develop sophisticated graphs of knowledge
within a single XML document instance. (See also the sidebar, Inclusions and
References (page 456))527[Com]

9.2.2 Comparing Metamodels: JSON, XML and RDF
Now that we are familiar with the various kinds of metamodels used to struc­
ture resource descriptions, we can take a closer look at some specific metamo­
dels. A detailed comparison of the affordances of different metamodels is be­
yond the scope of this chapter. Here we will simply take a brief look at three
popular metamodels—JSON, XML, and RDF—in order to see how they further
specify and constrain the more general kinds of metamodels introduced above.

9.2.2.1 JSON
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a textual format for exchanging data
that borrows its metamodel from the JavaScript programming language.
Specifically, the JSON metamodel consists of two kinds of structures found
in JavaScript: lists (called “arrays” in JavaScript) and dictionaries (called
“objects” in JavaScript). Lists and dictionaries contain values, which may be
strings of text, numbers, Booleans (true or false), or the null (empty) value.
Again, these types of values are taken directly from JavaScript. Lists and dic­
tionaries can be values too, meaning lists and dictionaries can be nested
within one another to produce more complex structures such as tables and
trees.
Lists, dictionaries, and a basic set of value types constitute the JSON metamo­
del. Because this metamodel is a subset of JavaScript, the JSON metamodel is
very easy to work with in JavaScript. Since JavaScript is the only programming
language that is available in all web browsers, JSON has become a popular
choice for developers who need to work with data and resource descriptions on
the web. (See §9.3.2 Writing Systems (page 464) later in this chapter.) Further­
more, many modern programming languages provide data structures and value
types equivalent to those provided by JavaScript. So, data represented as JSON
is easy to work with in many programming languages, not just JavaScript.

9.2.2.2 XML Information Set
The XML Information Set metamodel is derived from data structures used for
document markup. (See §5.2.2.2.) These markup structures—elements and at­
tributes—are well suited for programmatically manipulating the structure of
documents and data together.528[Com]
XML Infoset
The XML Infoset is a tree structure, where each node of the tree is defined
to be an “information item” of a particular type. Each information item has a
set of type-specific properties associated with it. At the root of the tree is a
“document item,” which has exactly one “element item” as its child. An ele­
ment item has a set of attribute items, and a list of child nodes. These child
9.2 Structuring Descriptions

451

The Discipline of Organizing

nodes may include other element items, or they may be character items.
(See §9.2.1 Kinds of Structures (page 442) below for more on characters.) At­
tribute items may contain character items, or they may contain typed data,
such as name tokens, identifiers and references. Element identifiers and ref­
erences (ID/IDREF) may be used to connect nodes, transforming a tree into
a graph. (See the sidebar, Inclusions and References (page 456))529[Com]
Figure 9.5, A Description Structure. is a graphical representation of how an XML
document might be used to structure part of a description of an author and his
works. This example demonstrates how we might use element items to model
the domain of the description, by giving them names such as author and title.
The character items that are the children of these elements hold the content of
the description: author names, book titles, and so on. Attribute items are used
to hold auxiliary information about this content, such as its language.

Figure 9.5. A Description Structure.

An XML document can be described as a tree in which elements are nodes that
can contain character content directly or attributes that contain character con­
tent.

This example also demonstrates how the XML Infoset supports mixed content
by allowing element items and character items to be “siblings” of the same pa­
rent element. In this case, the Infoset structure allows us to specify that the
452

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

book description can be displayed as a line of text consisting of the original title
and the translated title in parentheses. The elements and attributes are used to
indicate that this line of text consists of two titles written in different languages,
not a single title containing parentheses.
If not for mixed content, we could not write narrative text with hypertext links
embedded in the middle of a sentence. It gives us the ability to identify the sub­
components of a sentence, so that we could distinguish the terms “Sebald,”
“walking” and “East Anglia” as an author and two subjects.
Using schemas to define data representation formats is a good practice that fa­
cilitates shared understanding and contributes to long-term maintainability in
institutional or business contexts. An XML schema represents a contract among
the parties subscribing to its definitions, whereas JSON depends on out-of-band
communication among programmers. The notion that “the code is the documen­
tation” may be fashionable among programmers, but modelers prefer to design
at a higher level of abstraction and then implement.
The XML Infoset presents a strong contrast to JSON and does not always map in
a straightforward way to the data structures used in popular web scripting lan­
guages. Whereas JSON’s structures make it easier for object-oriented program­
mers to readily exchange data, they lack any formal schema language and can­
not easily handle mixed content.

9.2.2.3 RDF
In Figure 9.4, Descriptions Linked into a Graph., we structured our resource de­
scription as a graph by treating resources, properties, and values as nodes, with
edges reflecting their combination into descriptive statements. However, a more
common approach is to treat resources and values as nodes, and properties as
the edges that connect them. Figure 9.6, Treating Properties as Edges Rather
Than Nodes. shows the same description as Figure 9.4, Descriptions Linked into a
Graph., this time with properties treated as edges. This roughly corresponds to
the particular kind of graph metamodel defined by RDF. (§5.2.2.4 Resource De­
scription Framework (RDF) (page 223))
We have noted that we can treat a graph as a set of pairs of nodes, where each
pair may be connected by an edge. Similarly, we can treat each component of
the description in Figure 9.6, Treating Properties as Edges Rather Than Nodes. as
a pair of nodes (a resource and a value) with an edge (the property) linking
them. In the RDF metamodel, a pair of nodes and its edge is called a triple, be­
cause it consists of three parts (two nodes and one edge). The RDF metamodel
is a directed graph, so it identifies one node (the one from which the edge is
pointing) as the subject of the triple, and the other node (the one to which the
edge is pointing) as its object. The edge is referred to as the predicate or (as we
have been saying) property of the triple.

Figure 9.6. Treating Properties as Edges Rather Than Nodes.

We can treat each component of a description as a pair of nodes (a resource and
a value) with an edge (the property) linking them. Here, we have two book re­
sources that are related to four values through five properties. The single value
node, “Winfried George Sebald” is the subject of one book while being the au­
thor of the second book. The books are depicted as boxes, the edges as labeled
arrows and the values as text strings.

Figure 9.7, Listing Triples Individually. lists separately all the triples in Figure 9.6
However, there is something missing in Figure 9.7. Figure 9.6 clearly indicates
that the Winfried George Sebald who is the subject of book 1 is the same Win­
fried George Sebald who is the author of book 2. In Figure 9.7, Listing Triples In­
dividually. this relationship is not clear. How can we tell if the Winfried George
Sebald of the third triple is the same as the Winfried George Sebald of the triple
statement? For that matter, how can we tell if the first three triples all involve
the same book 1? This is easy to show in a diagram of the entire description

graph, where we can have multiple edges attached to a node. But when we dis­
aggregate that graph into triples, we need some way of uniquely referring to no­
des. We need identifiers (§4.4.3 Choosing Good Names and Identifiers (page
194)). When two triples have nodes with the same identifier, we can know that it
is the same node. RDF achieves this by associating URIs with nodes. (See
§5.2.2.4 Resource Description Framework (RDF) (page 223))
The need to identify nodes when we break down an RDF graph into triples be­
comes important when we want to “write” RDF graphs—create textual repre­
sentations of them instead of depicting them—so that they can be exchanged as
data. Tree structures do not necessarily have this problem, because it is

Inclusions and References
An XML Infoset is typically the result of processing a well-formed XML
document instance.530[Com] Schemas associated with XML document instan­
ces “inform” the corresponding XML Infoset. Thus, the “truth value” of any
XML Infoset is dependent upon its related schemas.531[Com] Traditionally, any
documentation that is related to the schema is considered to be part of the
schema definition and, at least notionally, informs human understanding
and interpretation of corresponding documents.532[Com]
The XML family offers several mechanisms to create inclusion relationships:
by employing element references; by way of entity definition and reference;
by using XML Inclusions (XInclude) or XLink. These inclusions and referen­
ces can also inform the XML Infoset, if they are processed.
Any XML node may refer to another node simply by referencing it by its as­
signed ID. Assuming attributes are declared, the Infoset exposes this infor­
mation as a references property as an ordered list of element information
items. That is to say that an element may contain other element nodes by
subordination, or by reference.533[Com]
XInclude “specifies a processing model and syntax for general purpose in­
clusion. Inclusion is accomplished by merging a number of XML information
sets into a single composite infoset.” XInclude offers the most versatile
mechanism for addressing whole documents, specific information items,
ranges of information items, and even parts of information items, which has
led to its widespread adoption in document processing.534[Com]
XLink “allows elements to be inserted into XML documents in order to cre­
ate and describe links between resources. It uses XML syntax to create
structures that can describe links similar to the simple unidirectional hyper­
links of today’s HTML, as well as more sophisticated links.”535[Com]
Entities are similar to macros found in many programming languages; a val­
ue is assigned to a token, the token is referenced wherever the value is nee­
ded, and macro expansion happens when the XML document instance is
read into the Infoset.536[Com] Entities are a handy feature, but since they are
expanded on their way in, entities do not survive as information items in the
XML Infoset. The ID/IDREF feature is more popular than the use of entities
because it carries more information into the XML Infoset.
possible to textually represent a tree structure without having to mention any
node more than once. Thus, one price paid for the generality and flexibility of
graph structures is the added complexity of recording, representing or writing
those structures.

9.2.2.4 Choosing Your Constraints
This tradeoff between flexibility and complexity illustrates a more general point
about constraints. In the context of managing and interacting with resource de­
scriptions, constraints are a good thing. As discussed above, a tree is a graph
with very specific constraints. These constraints allow you to do things with
trees that are not possible with graphs in general, such as representing them
textually without repeating yourself, or uniquely identifying nodes by the path
from the root of the tree to that node. This can make managing descriptions and
the resources they describe easier and more efficient—if a tree structure is a
good fit to the requirements of the organizing system. For example, an ordered
tree structure is a good fit for the hierarchical structure of the content of a book
or book-like document, such as an aircraft service manual or an SEC filing. On
the other hand, the network of relationships among the people and organiza­
tions that collaborated to produce a book might be better represented using a
graph structure. XML is most often used to represent hierarchies, but is also ca­
pable of representing network structures.

9.2.3 Modeling within Constraints
A metamodel imposes certain constraints on the structure of our resource de­
scriptions. But in organizing systems, we usually need to further specify the
content and composition of descriptions of the specific types of resources being
organized. For example, when designing a system for organizing books, it is not
sufficient to say that a book’s description is structured using XML, because the
XML metamodel constrains structure and not the content of descriptions. We
need also to specify that a book description includes a list of contributors, each
entry of which provides a name and indicates the role of that contributor. This
kind of specification is a model to which our descriptions of books are expected
to conform. (See §5.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Description (page 232).)
When designing an organizing system we may choose to reuse a standard mod­
el. For example, ONIX for Books is a standard model (conforming to the XML
metamodel) developed by the publishing industry for describing books.537[Bus]
If no such standard exists, or existing standards do not suit our needs, we may
create a new model for our specific domain. But we will not usually create a
new metamodel: instead we will make choices from among the metamodels,
such as JSON, XML, or RDF, that have been formally recognized and incorpora­
ted into existing standards. Once we have selected a metamodel, we know the
constraints we have to work with when modeling the resources and collections
in our specific domain.538[Com]

9.2 Structuring Descriptions

457

The Discipline of Organizing

9.2.3.1 Specifying Vocabularies and Schemas
Creating a model for descriptions of resources in a particular domain involves
specifying the common elements of those descriptions, and giving those ele­
ments standard names. (See §5.3 The Process of Describing Resources (page
227)) The model may also specify how these elements are arranged into larger
structures, for example, how they are ordered into lists nested into trees. Meta­
models vary in the tools they provide for specifying the structure and composi­
tion of domain-specific models, and in the maturity and robustness of the meth­
ods for designing them.539[Com] RDF and XML each provide different, metamodelspecific tools to define a model for a specific domain. But not every metamodel
provides such tools.
In XML, models are defined in separate documents known as schemas. An XML
schema defining a domain model provides a vocabulary of terms that can be
used as element and attribute names in XML documents that adhere to that
model. For example, Onix for Books schema specifies that an author of a book
should be called a Contributor, and that the page count should be called an Ex
tent. An XML schema also defines rules for how those elements, attributes, and
their content can be arranged into higher-level structures. For example, the
Onix for Books specifies that the description of a book must include a list of Con
tributor elements, that this list must have at least one element in it, and that
each Contributor element must have a ContributorRole child element.
If an XML schema is given an identifier, XML documents can use that identifier
to indicate that they use terms and rules from that schema. An XML document
may use vocabularies from more than one XML schema.540[Com] Associating a
schema with an XML instance enables validation: automatically checking that
vocabulary terms are being used correctly.541[Com]
If two descriptions share the same XML schema and use only that schema, then
combining them is straightforward. If not, it can be problematic, unless some­
one has figured out exactly how the two schemas should “map” to one another.
Finding such a mapping is not a trivial problem, as XML schemas may differ se­
mantically, lexically, structurally, or architecturally despite sharing a common
implementation form. (See Chapter 6, Describing Relationships and Structures.)
Tree structures can vary considerably while still conforming to the XML Infoset
metamodel. Users of XML often specify rules for checking whether certain pat­
terns appear in an XML document (document-level validation). This is less often
done with RDF, because graphs that conform to the RDF metamodel all have
the same structure: they are all sets of triples. This shared structure makes it
simple to combine different RDF descriptions without worrying about checking
structure at the document level. However, sometimes it is desirable to check de­
scriptions at the document level, as when part of a description is required. As
with XML, if consumers of those descriptions want to assert that they expect
458

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

those descriptions to have a certain structure (such as a required property),
they must check them at the document level.
Because the RDF metamodel already defines structure, defining a domainspecific model in RDF mainly involves specifying URIs and names for predi­
cates. A set of RDF predicate names and URIs is known as an RDF vocabulary.
Publication of vocabularies on the web and the use of URIs to identify and refer
to predicate definitions are key principles of Linked Data and the Semantic Web.
(Also see §6.8.1, as well as later in this chapter.)542[Web]
For example, the Resource Description and Access (RDA) standard for catalog­
ing library resources includes a set of RDF vocabularies defining predicates usa­
ble in cataloging descriptions. One such predicate is:
<http://rdvocab.info/Elements/extentOfText>

which is defined as “the number and type of units and/or subunits making up a
resource consisting of text, with or without accompanying illustrations.” The vo­
cabulary further specifies that this predicate is a refinement of a more general
predicate:
<http://rdvocab.info/Elements/extent>

which can be used to indicate, “the number and type of units and/or subunits
making up a resource” regardless of whether it is textual or not.
JSON lacks any standardized way to define which terms can be used. That does
not mean one cannot use a standard vocabulary when creating descriptions us­
ing JSON, only that there is no agreed-upon way to use JSON to communicate
which vocabulary is being used, and no way to automatically check that it is be­
ing used correctly.

9.2.3.2 Controlling Values
So far, we have focused on how models specify vocabularies of terms and how
those terms can be used in descriptions. But models may also constrain the val­
ues or content of descriptions. Sometimes, a single model will define both the
terms that can be used for property names and the terms that can be used for
property values. For example, an XML schema may enumerate a list of valid
terms for an attribute value.543[Com]
Often, however, there are separate, specialized vocabularies of terms intended
for use as property values in resource descriptions. Typically these vocabularies
provide values for use within statements that describe what a resource is about.
Examples of such subject vocabularies include the Library of Congress Subject
Headings (LOC-SH) and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Other vocabula­
ries may provide authoritative names for people, corporations, or places. Classi­

9.2 Structuring Descriptions

459

The Discipline of Organizing

fication schemes are yet another kind of vocabulary, providing the category
names for use as the values in descriptive statements that classify resources.
Because different metamodels take different approaches to specifying vocabula­
ries, there will usually be different versions of these vocabularies for use with
different metamodels. For example the LCSH are available both as XML con­
forming to the Metadata Authority Description Standard (MADS) schema, and
as RDF using the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary.
Specifying a vocabulary is just one way models can control what values can be
assigned to properties. Another strategy is to specify what types of values can
be assigned. For example, a model for book descriptions may specify that the
value of a pages property must be a positive integer. Or it could be more specif­
ic; a course catalog might give each course an identifier that contains a twoletter department code followed by a 1-3 digit course number. Specifying a data
type like this with a regular expression narrows down the set of possible values
for the property without having to enumerate every possible value. (See the
sidebar.)
In addition to or in lieu of specifying a type, a model may specify an encoding
scheme for values. An encoding scheme is a specialized writing system or syn­
tax for particular types of values. For example, a model like Atom for describing
syndicated web content requires a publication date. But there are many differ­
ent ways to write dates: 9/2/76, 2 Sept. 1976, September 2nd 1976, etc. Atom also
specifies an encoding scheme for date values. The encoding scheme is
RFC3339, a standard for writing dates. When using RFC3339, one always writes
a date using the same form: 1976-09-02.545[Com]
Encoding schemes are often defined in conjunction with standardized identifi­
ers. (See §4.4.3.1 Make Names Informative (page 195).) For example, Interna­
tional Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) are not just sequences of Arabic numer­
als: they are values written using the ISBN encoding scheme. This scheme
specifies how to separate the sequence of numerals into parts, and how each of
these parts should be interpreted. The ISBN 978-3-8218-4448-0 has five parts,
the first three of which indicate that the resource with this identifier is 1) a
product of the book publishing industry, 2) published in a German-speaking
country, and 3) published by the publishing house Eichborn.
Encoding schemes can be viewed as very specialized models of particular kinds
of information, such as dates or book identifiers. But because they specify not
only the structure of this information, but also how it should be written, we can
also view them as specialized writing systems. That is, encoding schemes speci­
fy how to textually represent information.
In the second half of this chapter, we will focus on the issues involved in textual­
ly representing resource descriptions—writing them. Graphs, trees, dictio­

Regular Expressions
Regular expressions have been used to describe patterns in text documents
since the early days of computing and came into widespread use when Ken
Thompson incorporated them into early UNIX text processing tools, such as
ed and grep. There are too many variations of regular expression syntax for
us to detail them here, but it is worthwhile to consider them briefly while
we are on the subject of controlling values.546[Com]
Regular expressions are employed by modern text processing tools for se­
lection and retrieval purposes. In search and replace applications, one
might search for the string “Chapter [1-5]” to express your intent to select
chapters 1 through 5, or “it[’]?s” to locate every use of “it’s” and “its” in a
manuscript; this capability is highly valued by anyone who has had to edit a
book. Programmers and data modelers use regular expressions to describe
expected encoding schemes when they design documents, data elements,
databases, and encoding schemes. You experience regular expression pro­
cessing when you enter a phone number or postal code into a Web-based
form. Many data modeling, programming and XML schema languages em­
ploy regular expressions to control data entry and validation of values. In
the context of controlling values, we can use regular expressions to de­
scribe data values as varied as identifiers, names, dates, telephone num­
bers, and postal codes. We can, likewise, define rules for white space han­
dling and punctuation within a data value.
naries, lists, and sets are general types of structures found in different metamo­
dels. Thinking about these broad types and how they fit or do not fit the ways
we want to model our resource descriptions can help us select a specific meta­
model. Specific metamodels such as the XML Infoset or RDF are formalized and
standardized definitions of the more general types of structures discussed
above. Once we have selected a metamodel, we know the constraints we have to
work with when modeling the resources and collections in our specific domain.
But because metamodels are abstract and exist only on a conceptual level, they
can only take us so far. If we want to create, store, and exchange individual re­
source descriptions, we need to make the structures defined by our abstract
metamodels concrete. We need to write them.

9.3 Writing Descriptions
Suppose that I am organizing books, and I have decided that it is important for
the purposes of this organizing to know the title of each book and how many pa­
ges it has. Before me I have a book, which I examine to determine that its title is
Die Ringe des Saturn and it has 371 pages. Example 9.5, Basic ways of writing
part of a book description. lists a few of the ways to write this description. Let us
examine these various forms of writing to see what they have in common and
where they differ.

Example 9.5. Basic ways of writing part of a book description.
The title is Die Ringe des Saturn and it has 371 pages.
{ book: {"title":"Die Ringe des Saturn","pages":371} }
<book pages="371"> <title>Die Ringe des Saturn</title> </book>
<div class="book">The title is
<span class="title">Die Ringe des Saturn</span>
and it has <span class="pages">371 pages.</span>

<http://lccn.loc.gov/96103072>
<http://rdvocab.info/Elements/title> "Die Ringe des Saturn"@de ;
<http://rdvocab.info/Elements/extentOfText> "371 p." .

We examine the notations, writing systems and syntax of each of these descrip­
tion forms, and others, in the following sections.

9.3.1 Notations
First, let us look at the actual marks on the page. To write you must make marks
or—more likely—select from a menu of marks using a keyboard. In either case,
you are using a notation: a set of characters with distinct forms.547[Com] The Latin
alphabet is a notation, as are Arabic numerals. Some more exotic notations in­
clude the symbols used for editorial markup and alchemical symbols.548[Com] The
characters in a notation usually have an ordering. Arabic numerals are ordered
1 2 3 and so on. English-speaking children usually learn the ordering of the Lat­
in alphabet in the form of an alphabet song.549[CogSci]
A character may belong to more than one notation. The examples in Exam­
ple 9.5, Basic ways of writing part of a book description. use characters from a
few different notations: the letters of the Latin alphabet, Arabic numerals, and a
handful of auxiliary marks: . { } " :< > / $ Collectively, all of these characters
—alphabet, numerals, and auxiliary marks—also belong to a notation called the
American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).550[Com]

462

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

ASCII is an example of a notation that has been codified and standardized for
use in a digital environment. A traditional notation like the Latin alphabet can
withstand a certain degree of variation in the form of a particular mark. Two
people might write the letter A rather differently, but as long as they can mutu­
ally recognize each other’s marks as an “A,” they can successfully share a nota­
tion. Computers, however, cannot easily accommodate such variation. Each
character must be strictly defined. In the case of ASCII, each character is given
a number from 0 to 127, so that there are 128 ASCII characters.551[Com] When us­
ing a computer to type ASCII characters, each key you press selects a character
from this “menu” of 128 characters. A notation that has had numbers assigned
to its characters is called a character encoding.

The most ambitious character coding in existence is Unicode, which as of ver­
sion 6.0 assigns numbers to 109,449 characters.552[Com] Unicode makes the im­
portant distinction between characters and glyphs. A character is the smallest
meaningful unit of a written language. In alphabet-based languages like Eng­
lish, characters are letters; in languages like Chinese, characters are ideo­
graphs. Unicode treats all of these characters as abstract ideas (Latin capital A)
rather than specific marks (A A A A). A specific mark that can be used to depict
a character is a glyph. A font is a collection of glyphs used to depict some set of
characters. A Unicode font explicitly associates each glyph with a particular
9.3 Writing Descriptions

463

The Discipline of Organizing

number in the Unicode character encoding. The inability of computers to use
contextual understanding to bridge the gap between various glyphs and the ab­
stract character depicted by those glyphs turns out to have important conse­
quences for organizing systems.
Different notations may include very similar marks. For example, modern music
notation includes marks for indicating the pitch of note, known as accidentals.
One of these music notation marks is ♯ (“sharp”). The sharp sign looks very
much like the symbol used in English as an abbreviation for the word number,
as in We’re #1!553[Ling] If you were to write a sharp sign and a number sign by
hand, they would probably look identical. In a non-digital environment, we
would rely on context to understand whether the written mark was being used
as part of music notation, or mathematical notation, or as an English abbrevia­
tion.
Computers, however, have no such intuitive understanding of context. Unicode
encodes the number sign and the sharp sign as two different characters. As far
as a computer using Unicode is concerned, ♯ and # are completely different,
and the fact that they have similar-looking glyphs is irrelevant. That is a prob­
lem if, for example, a cataloger has carefully described a piece of music by cor­
rectly using the sharp sign, but a person looking for that piece of music search­
es for descriptions using the number sign (since that is what you get when you
press the keyboard button with the symbol that most closely resembles a sharp
sign).554[Com]

9.3.2 Writing Systems
A writing system employs one or more notations, and adds a set of rules for us­
ing them. Most writing systems assume knowledge of a particular human lan­
guage. These writing systems are known as glottic writing systems. But there
are many writing systems, such as mathematical and musical ones, that are not
tied to human languages in this way. Many of the writing systems used for de­
scribing resources belong to this latter group, meaning that (at least in princi­
ple) they can be used with equal facility by speakers of any language.
Glottic writing systems, being grounded in natural human languages, are diffi­
cult to describe precisely and comprehensively. Non-glottic writing systems, on
the other hand, can be described precisely and comprehensively using an ab­
stract model. That is the connection between the structural perspective taken in
the previous section, and the textual perspective taken in this section. A nonglottic writing system is described by a particular metamodel, and structures
that fit within the constraints of a given metamodel can be textually represented
using one or more writing systems that are described by that metamodel.
Some writing systems are closely identified with specific metamodels. For exam­
ple, XML and JSON are both 1) metamodels for structuring information and 2)
464

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

writing systems for textually representing information. In other words, they
specify both the abstract structure of a description and how to write it down. It
is possible to conceive of other ways to textually represent the structure of
these metamodels, but for each of these metamodels just one writing system
has been standardized.555[Com]
RDF, on the other hand, is only a metamodel, not a writing system. RDF only
defines an abstract structure, not how to write that structure. So how do we
write information that is structured as RDF? It turns out that we have many
choices. Unlike XML and JSON, several different writing systems for the RDF
metamodel have been standardized, including N-Triples, Turtle, RDFa, and RDF/
XML.556[Com] Each of these is a writing system that is abstractly described by the
RDF metamodel.
Writing systems provide rules for arranging characters from a notation into
meaningful structures. A character in a notation has no inherent meaning. Char­
acters in a notation only take on meaning in the context of a writing system that
uses that notation. For example: what does the letter I from the Latin alphabet
mean? That question can only be answered by looking at how it is being used in
a particular writing system. If the writing system is American English, then
whether I has a meaning depends on whether it is grouped with other letters or
whether it stands alone. Only in the latter case does it have an assignable mean­
ing. However in the arithmetic writing system of ancient Rome, which also uses
as a notation the letters of the Latin alphabet, I has a different meaning: one.
This example also serves to illustrate how the ordering of a notation can differ
from the ordering of a writing system that uses that notation. According to the
ordering of the Latin alphabet, the twelfth letter L comes before the twentysecond letter V. But in the Roman numeric writing system, V (the number 5)
comes before L (the number 50). Unless we know which ordering we are using,
we cannot arrange L and V “in order.”557[Ling]

9.3 Writing Descriptions

465

The Discipline of Organizing

This kind of difference in ordering can arise in more subtle ways as well. When
we alphabetically order names, we first compare the first character of each
name, and arrange them according to the ordering of the writing system. The
first known use of alphabetical ordering was in the Library of Alexandria about
two thousand years ago, when Zenodotus arranged the collection according to
the first letter of resource names.558[Ling] If the first characters of two names are
the same, we compare the second character, and so on. We can also apply this
same kind of ordering procedure to sequences of numerals. If we do, then 334
will come before 67, because 3 (the first character of the first sequence) comes
before 6 (the first character of the second sequence) according to the ordering
of our notation (Arabic numerals). However, it is more common when ordering
sequences of numerals to treat them as decimal numbers, and thus to use the
ordering imposed by the decimal system. In the decimal writing system, 67 pre­
cedes 334, since the latter is a greater number.
This difference is important for organizing systems. Computers will sort values
differently depending on whether they are treating sequences of numerals as
numbers or just as sequences. Some organizing systems mix multiple ways of
ordering the same characters. For example, Library of Congress call numbers
have four parts, and sequences of Arabic numerals can appear in three of them.
In the second part, indicating a narrow subject area, and fourth part, indicating
year of publication, sequences of numerals are treated as numbers and ordered
according to the decimal system. In the third part, however, sequences of nu­
merals are treated as sequences and ordered “notationally” as in the example
above (334 before 67).
Differences in ordering demonstrate just one way that multiple writing systems
may use the same notation differently. For example, the American English and
British English writing systems both use the same Latin alphabet, but impose
slightly different spelling rules.559[Ling] The Japanese writing system employs a
number of notations, including traditional Chinese characters (kanji) as well as
the Latin alphabet (rōmaji). Often, writing systems do not share the same exact
notation but have mostly overlapping notations. Many European languages, for
example, extend the Latin alphabet with characters such as Å and Ü that add
additional marks, known as diacritics, to the basic characters.560[Com]
In organizing systems it is often necessary to represent values from one writing
system in another writing system that uses a different notation, a process
known as transliteration. For example, early computer systems only supported
the ASCII notation, so text from writing systems that extend the Latin alphabet
had to be converted to ASCII, usually by removing (or sometimes transliterat­
ing) diacritics. This made the non-ASCII text usable in an ASCII-based compu­
terized organizing system, at the expense of information loss.

466

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

Even in modern computer systems that support Unicode, however, translitera­
tion is often needed to support organizing activities by users who cannot read
text written using its original system. The Library of Congress and the American
Library Association provide standard procedures for transliterating text from
over sixty different writing systems into the (extended) Latin alphabet.

9.3.3 Syntax
The examples in Example 9.5, Basic ways of writing part of a book description.
express the same information using different writing systems. The examples use
the same notation (ASCII) but differ in their syntax: the rules that define how
characters can be combined into words and how words can be combined into
higher-level structures.561[Com]
• Consider the first entry: The title is Die Ringe des Saturn and it has 371 pa­
ges. The leading capital letter and the period ending this sequence of char­
acters indicate to us that this is a sentence. This sentence is one way we
might use the English writing system to express two statements about the
book we are describing. A statement is one distinct fact or piece of informa­
tion. In glottic writing systems like English, there is usually more than one
sentence we could write to express the same statement. For example, in­
stead of it has 371 pages we might have written the number of pages is 371.
English writing also enables us to construct complex sentences that express
more than one statement.562[Ling]
In contrast, when we create descriptions of resources in an organizing sys­
tem, we generally use non-glottic writing systems in which each sentence
only expresses a single statement, and there is just one way to write a sen­
tence that expresses a given statement.563[Com] These restrictions make these
writing systems less expressive, but simplify their use. In particular, since
there is a one-to-one correspondence between sentences and statements, we
can drop the distinction and just talk about the statements of a description.
Now we return to our example and look at the structure of the statement,
The title is Die Ringe des Saturn and it has 371 pages. Spaces are used to
separate the text into words, and English syntax defines the functions of
those words. The verb is in this statement functions to link the word title to
the phrase Die Ringe des Saturn. This is typical of the kind of statements
found in a resource description. Each statement identifies and describes
some aspect of the resource. In this case, the statement attributes the value
Die Ringe des Saturn to the property title.
As we saw when we looked at description structures, we can analyze de­
scriptions as involving properties of resources and their corresponding val­
ues or content. In a writing system like English, it is not always so straight­
forward to determine which words refer to properties and which refer to val­
9.3 Writing Descriptions

467

The Discipline of Organizing

ues. (This is why blobs are not ideal description structures.) Writing systems
designed for expressing resource descriptions, on the other hand, usually
define syntax that makes this determination easier. In our dictionary exam­
ples above, we used an arrow character → to indicate the relationship be­
tween properties and values.
This ease of distinguishing properties and values comes at a price, however.
The syntax of English is forgiving: we can read a sentence with somewhat
garbled syntax such as 371 pages it has and often still make out its mean­
ing.564[Ling] This is usually not the case with writing systems intended for ex­
pressing resource descriptions. These systems strictly define their rules for
how characters can be combined into higher-level structures. Structures
that follow the rules are well formed according to that system.
• Take for example the second entry in Example 9.5, Basic ways of writing part
of a book description..
{ book: {"title":"Die Ringe des Saturn","pages":371} }

This fragment is written in JSON. As explained earlier in this chapter, JSON
is a metamodel for structuring information using lists and dictionaries. But
JSON is also a writing system, which borrows its syntax from JavaScript. The
JSON syntax uses brackets to textually represent lists [1,2,3] and braces to
textually represent dictionaries {title:"Die Ringe des Saturn", "pages":
371}. Within braces, the colon character : is used to link properties with
their values, much as is was used in the previous example. So "pages":371 is
a statement assigning the value 371 to the property pages.
• The third fragment is written in XML.
<book pages="371"> <title>Die Ringe des Saturn</title> </book>

Like JSON, XML is a metamodel and also a writing system. Here we have
XML elements and attributes. XML elements are textually represented as
tags that are marked using the special characters <, > and /. So, this frag­
ment of XML consists of a book element with a child element, title, and a
pages attribute, each of which has some text content. In this case, pa
ges="371" is a statement assigning the value 371 to the property pages. The
difference is syntax is subtle; quotation marks surround the value and equal
sign = is used to assign the property to its value.
• The fourth is a fragment of HTML.
<div class="book">The title is
<span class="title">Die Ringe des Saturn</span>
and it has <span class="pages">371 pages.</span>
</div>

468

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

The writing system that HTML employs is close enough to XML to ignore
any differences in syntax. In this example, the CLASS attribute contains the
property name and the property value is the element content.
• The fifth entry is a fragment of Turtle, one of the writing systems for RDF.
<http://lccn.loc.gov/96103072>
<http://rdvocab.info/Elements/title> "Die Ringe des Saturn"@de ;
<http://rdvocab.info/Elements/extentOfText> "371 p." .

Turtle provides a syntax for writing down RDF triples. Each triple consists of
a subject, predicate, and object separated by spaces. Recall that RDF uses
URIs to identify subjects, predicates, and some objects; these URIs are writ­
ten in Turtle by enclosing them in angle brackets < >. Triples are separated
by period . characters, but triples that share the same subject can be writ­
ten more compactly by writing the subject only once, and then writing the
predicate and object of each triple, separated by a semicolon ; character.
This is what we see in Example 9.2, Nesting an author description within a
book description: two triples that share a subject.
The two fragments in Example 9.6, Writing part of a book description in Seman­
tic XML. demonstrate namespaces, terms from the Dublin Core and DocBook
namespaces, and the facility with which XML embraces semantic encoding of
description resources.

Example 9.6. Writing part of a book description in Semantic XML.
<book xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" dc:extent="371 p.">
<dc:title>Die Ringe des Saturn</title>
...
</book>
<book xmlns:db="http://www.docbook.org/xml/4.5/docbookx.dtd">
<bookinfo>
<title>Die Ringe des Saturn</title>
<pagenums>371 p.</pagenums>...</bookinfo>
...
</book>

• The first example extends the third fragment from Example 9.5, Basic ways
of writing part of a book description.; the xmlns:dc="..." segment is a name­
space declaration, which is associating dc with the quoted URI, which hap­
pens to be the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI); the child <dc:title>
element and the attached dc:extent="371" tell us that the corresponding val­
ues are attributable to the title and extent properties, respectively, from the
Dublin Core namespace.
• The next fragment employs DocBook DTD namespace; we now have a <page
nums> element for which the meaning is contextually obvious; the title is still

a title; an extra layer of markup reflects the fact that it could be metadata in
the source file of a book that is being edited, is in production or is on your
favorite tablet right now.565[Com]

Microformats, RDFa and Microdata
When Tim Berners-Lee deployed HTML, its syntax contained the basic ele­
ments and attributes needed to make formal statements about the docu­
ment as a whole by using <LINK/>, or about specific parts of the document
by using the <A> element. Each of these elements have four attributes in
common: the famous HREF attribute contains a URI that names an object
resource; the NAME attribute allows the element to be the target end of a
link; the REL and REV attributes contain descriptions of the link relations.
Microformats, RDFa and Microdata are the latest generation of metadata
extensions to HTML. Each approach is widely used on the web and by
search engines. As such, they are potential targets when transforming into
HTML from richer semantic formats.
Microformats are the simplest of the three. It uses controlled vocabularies
of terms in REL/REV, and in the CLASS attribute, to declare high-level infor­
mation types.
RDFa is RDF in Attributes. That is, RDFa is a formal specification for writing
RDF expressions by using attributes in XML and HTML documents. It uses
an ABOUT attribute to name the subject of the relation; the REL and REV
attributes; HREF is joined by SRC and RESOURCE to name the object of the
link; a TYPEOF attribute declares a type; PROPERTY and CONTENT attrib­
utes are used to attribute a value to an object’s property.
Microdata is similar, inasmuch as it uses attributes extensively. The pres­
ence of an ITEMSCOPE attribute identifies an item while the ITEMTYPE at­
tribute value identifies its type; ITEMID declares an items name or unique
identifier; ITEMPROP is a name value pair, and; ITEMREF relates this item
to other elements that are outside of the scope of the container element.
The two fragments in Example 9.7, Writing part of a book description in RDFa or
microdata. demonstrate RDFa and microdata formats, which each rely upon spe­
cific attributes to establish the type of the property values contained by the
HTML elements. In each example, the book title is contained by a <span> ele­
ment. Whereas RDFa relies upon the property attribute, the microdata example
employs the itemprop attribute to specify that the contents of the element is, ef­
fectively, a “title” in exactly the same sense as we know that the contents of
<dc:title> is a “title.”

9.4 Worlds of Description
In the previous two sections we have considered descriptions as designed ob­
jects with particular structures and as written documents with particular syn­
taxes. As we have seen, there are many possible choices of structure and syn­
tax. But these choices are never made in isolation. Just as an architect or de­
signer must work within the constraints of the existing built environment, and
just as any author must work with existing writing systems, descriptions are al­
ways created as part of a pre-existing “world” over which any one of us has lit­
tle control.
In the final part of this chapter, we will consider how choices of structure and
syntax have converged historically into broad patterns of usage. For lack of a
better term, we call these broad patterns “worlds.” “World” is not a technical
term and should not be taken too literally: the broad areas of application sketch­
ed here have considerable overlap, and there are many other ways one might
identify patterns of description structure and syntax. That said, the three worlds
described here do reflect real patterns of description form that influence tool
and technology choices. In your own work creating and managing resource de­
scriptions, it is likely that you will need to think about how your descriptions fit
into one or more of these worlds.

9.4.1 The Document Processing World
The first world we will consider is concerned primarily with the creation, pro­
cessing and management of hybrid narrative-transactional documents such as
instruction manuals, textbooks, or annotated medieval manuscripts. (See The
Document Type Spectrum (page 168)). These are quite different kinds of docu­
ments, but they all contain a mixture of narrative text and structured data, and
they all can be usefully modeled as tree structures. Because of these shared
qualities, tools as different as publishing software, supply-chain management
software, and scholarly editing software have all converged on common XMLbased solutions. (“The XML world” would be another appropriate name for the
document-processing world.)

9.4 Worlds of Description

The Discipline of Organizing

This convergence was no accident, because XML was designed specifically to
address the problem of how to add structure and data to documents by “mark­
ing them up.” XML is the descendant of Standard Generalized Markup Lan­
guage (SGML), which in turn descended from International Business Ma­
chines (IBM)’s Generalized Markup Language, which was invented to enable
the production and management of large-scale technical documentation. The ex­
plicitness of markup makes it well-suited for representing structure and content
type distinctions in institutional contexts, where the scope, scale, and expected
lifetime of organizing systems for information implies reuse by unknown people
for unanticipated purposes.
The abstract data model underlying XML is called the XML Information Set or
Infoset. The Infoset defines a document as a partially ordered tree of “informa­
tion items.” Every XML document can thus be understood as a specific kind of
tree, although not every tree structure is expressible as an XML docu­
ment.566[Com]
As we discussed in Inclusions and References (page 456), XML has the ability to
describe graphs by incorporating the use of ID and IDREF attribute types to
create references among element information items within the same document.
This modest form of hypertext linking allows us to present the following docu­
ment fragment that approximates the graph we saw modeled in Figure 9.4, De­
scriptions Linked into a Graph.

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

As one might expect, tools and technologies in the document-processing world
are optimized for manipulating and combining tree structures. A “toolchain” is
set of tools intended to be used together to achieve some goal.

The XML Toolchain
The XML toolchain is quite comprehensive. It consists of tools for creating
XML documents (XML editors), tools for expressing logical document and
data models (DTD, XML Schema, REgular LAnguage for XML Next Genera­
tion (RELAX NG), Schematron), tools for transforming XML documents
(XSLT), tools for describing document processing “pipelines” (XProc: An
XML Pipeline Language), and tools for storing and querying collections of
XML documents (XML databases, queried using XML Query Lan­
guage (XQuery)). Used together, these tools provide very powerful means of
working with tree-structured documents. XML editors incorporate knowl­
edge of DTDs, schemas, transformations, style sheets, queries, databases
and pipelines. Pipelines choreograph the plumbing and inter-dependencies
involved in processing a complex dataset and publishing a useful result in
one or more output formats.
For programmers who do not to use the XML toolchain, other programming lan­
guages also provide libraries for working with XML. This fact has led some to
propose, and others to believe, that XML is a kind of universal format for ex­
changing data among systems. However, programmers have observed that a
random XML Infoset does not map easily to the data structures commonly found
in many programming languages. “Working with XML” frequently means trans­
lating from XML tree structures to data structures native to another language,
usually meaning lists and dictionaries. This translation can be problematic and
often means giving up many of the strengths of XML. By the same token, there
are decades more practical experience working with markup languages and in­
stitutional publishing than there is with JSON and RDF.
XML is not a universal solution for every possible problem. That does not mean
that it is not the best solution for a wide variety of problems, including yours. To
gauge whether your resource descriptions are, or ought to be, part of the
document-processing world, ask yourself the following questions:
• Do my resource descriptions contain mixtures of narrative text, hypertext,
structured data and a variety of media formats?
• Can my descriptions easily be modeled using tree structures, hypertext
links, and transclusion?
• Are the vocabularies I need or want to use made available using XML tech­
nologies?

9.4 Worlds of Description

473

The Discipline of Organizing

• Do I need to work with a body of existing descriptions already encoded as
XML?
• Do I need to interoperate with processes or partners that utilize the XML
toolchain?
• Do I need to publish my resource descriptions in multiple formats from a sin­
gle source?
If the answer to one or more of these questions is “yes,” then chances are good
that you are working within the document processing world, and you will need
to become familiar with conceptualizing your descriptions as trees and working
with them using XML tools.

9.4.2 The Web World
The second “world” emerged in the early 1990s with the creation of the World
Wide Web. The web was developed to address a need for simple and rapid shar­
ing of scientific data. Of course, it has grown far beyond that initial use case,
and is now a ubiquitous infrastructure for all varieties of information and com­
munication services. (“The browser world” would be another appropriate name
for what we are calling the Web World.)
Documents, data, and services on the web are conceptualized as resources,
identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), and accessible through rep­
resentations transferred via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Representa­
tions are sequences of bytes, and could be HTML pages, JPEG images, tabular
data, or practically anything else transferable via HTTP. No matter what they
are, representations transferred over the web include descriptions of them­
selves. These descriptions take the form of property-value pairs, known as
“HTTP headers.” The HTTP headers of web representations are structured as
dictionaries.
Dictionary structures appear many other places in web infrastructure. URIs may
include a query component beginning with a ? character. This component is
used for purposes such as providing query parameters to search services. The
query component is commonly structured as a dictionary, consisting of a series
of property-value pairs separated by the & character. For example, the following
URI:
https://www.google.com/search?q=sebald&tbs=qdr:m

includes the query component q=sebald&tbs=qdr:m. This is a dictionary with the
properties q and tbs, respectively specifying the search term and temporal con­
straints on the search.
Data entered into an HTML form is also structured as a dictionary. When an
HTML form is submitted, the entered data is used either to compose the query
474

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

component of a URI, or to create a new representation to be transferred to a
web server. In either case, the data is structured as a set of properties and their
corresponding values.
HTML documents are structured as trees, but descriptions embedded within
HTML documents can also be structured as dictionaries. HTML documents may
include a dictionary of metadata elements, each of which specifies a property
and its value. Recently support for microdata was added to HTML, which is an­
other method of adding dictionaries of property-value pairs to documents. Using
microdata, authors can annotate web content with additional information, mak­
ing it easier to automatically extract structured descriptions of that con­
tent.567[Web] Microformats are another method for doing this by mapping existing
HTML attributes and values to (nested) dictionary structures.568[Web]
Dictionary structures are easy to work with in any programming language, and
they pervade various popular frameworks for programming the Web. In the pro­
gramming languages used to implement web services, HTTP headers and query
parameters are easily mapped to dictionary data structures native to those lan­
guages. On the client side, there is only one programming language that runs
within all web browsers: JavaScript. The dictionary is the fundamental data
structure within JavaScript as well.
Thus it is unsurprising that JSON, a dictionary-structured, JavaScript-based syn­
tax, has become the de facto standard for application-to-application interchange
of data on the web in contexts that do not involve business transactions. Web
services providing structured data intended for programmatic use can make
that data available as JSON, which is well-suited for use either by JavaScript
programs running within browsers, or by programs written in other languages
running outside of browsers (e.g., smart phone applications).
It is now commonly accepted that there are useful differences of approach be­
tween the document-processing world and the Web World. This does not mean
that the two worlds do not have significant overlaps. Some very important web
representation types are XML-based, such as the Atom syndication format.
Trees will continue to be the structure of choice for web representations that
consist primarily of narrative rather than transactional data. But for structured
descriptions that are intended to be accessed and manipulated on the Web, dic­
tionary structures currently rule.
To gauge whether your resource descriptions are or ought to be part of the Web
world, ask yourself the following questions:
• Is the web the primary platform upon which I will be making my descrip­
tions available?
• Are my resource descriptions primarily structured, transaction-oriented da­
ta?
9.4 Worlds of Description

475

The Discipline of Organizing

• Can my descriptions easily be modeled as lists of properties and values (dic­
tionaries)?
• Are the vocabularies I need or want to use made available primarily using
HTML technologies such as microdata or microformats?
• Do I need to make my descriptions easily usable for use within a wide array
of programming languages?
If the answer to one or more of these questions is “yes,” then chances are good
that you are working within the Web World, and you will need to become famili­
ar with conceptualizing your descriptions as dictionaries and working with them
using programming languages such as JavaScript.

9.4.3 The Semantic Web World
The last world we consider is still somewhat of a possible world, at least in com­
parison with the previous two. While the document processing world and the
web world are well-established, the Semantic Web world is only starting to
emerge, despite having been envisioned over a decade ago.
The vision of a Semantic Web world builds upon the web world, but adds some
further prescriptions and constraints for how to structure descriptions. The Se­
mantic Web world unifies the concept of a resource as it has been developed in
this book, with the web notion of a resource as anything with a URI. On the Se­
mantic Web, anything being described must have a URI. Furthermore, the de­
scriptions must be structured as graphs, adhering to the RDF metamodel and
relating resources to one another via their URIs. Advocates of Linked Data fur­
ther prescribe that those descriptions must be made available as representa­
tions transferred over HTTP.569[Web]
This is a departure from the web world. The web world is also structured
around URIs, but it does not require that every resource being described have a
URI. For example, in the web world a list of bibliographic descriptions of books
by W.G. Sebald might be published at a specific URI, but the individual books
themselves might not have URIs. In the Semantic Web world, in addition to the
list having a URIs, each book would have a URI too, in addition to whatever oth­
er identifiers it might have.570[Web]
Making an HTTP request to an individual book URI may return a graphstructured description of that book, if best practices for Linked Data are being
followed. This, too, is a departure from the web world, which is agnostic about
the form representations or descriptions of resources should take (although as
we have seen, dictionary structures are often favored on the web when the cli­
ents consuming those descriptions are computer programs). On the Semantic
Web, all descriptions are structured as RDF graphs. Each description graph
links to other description graphs by referring to these related resources using
476

Chapter 9 — The Forms of Resource Descriptions

Informatics Edition

their URIs. Thus, at least in theory, all description graphs on the Semantic Web
are linked into a single massive graph structure. In practice, however, it is far
from clear that this is an achievable, or even a desirable, goal.
Although the Semantic Web is in its infancy, a significant number of resource
descriptions have already been made available in accordance with the princi­
ples outlined above. Descriptions published according to these principles are of­
ten referred to as “Linked Data.” Prominent examples include: DBpedia, a graph
of descriptions of subjects of Wikipedia articles; the Virtual International Au­
thority File (VIAF), a graph of descriptions of names collected from various na­
tional libraries’ name authority files; GeoNames, a graph of descriptions of pla­
ces; and Data.gov.uk, a graph of descriptions of public data made available by
the UK government.571[Web]
Despite the growing amount of Linked Data, tools for working with graphstructured data are still immature in comparison to the XML toolchain and Web
programming languages. Although there is an XML syntax for RDF, using the
XML toolchain to work with graph-structured data is generally a bad idea. And
just as most programming languages do not support natively working with tree
structures, most do not support natively working with graph structures either.
Storing and querying graph-structured data efficiently requires a graph data­
base or triple store.
Still, the Semantic Web world has much to recommend it. Having a common
way of identifying resources (the URI) and a single shared metamodel (RDF) for
all resource descriptions makes it much easier to combine descriptions from dif­
ferent sources. To gauge whether your resource descriptions are or ought to be
part of the Semantic Web world, ask yourself the following questions:
• Is the web the primary platform upon which I will be making my descrip­
tions available?
• Is it important that I be able to easily and freely aggregate the elements of
my descriptions in different ways and to combine them with descriptions
created by others?
• Are my descriptions best modeled as graph structures?
• Have the vocabularies I need or want to use been created using RDF?
• Do I need to work with a body of existing descriptions that have been pub­
lished as Linked Data?
If the answer to one or more of these questions is “yes,” then chances are good
that you should be working within the Semantic Web world, and you ought to
become familiar with conceptualizing your descriptions as graphs and working
with them using Semantic Web tools.

9.5 Key Points in Chapter Nine
• We can approach the problem of how to form resource descriptions from two
perspectives: structuring and writing.
(See §9.1 Introduction (page 437))
• Metamodels describe structures commonly found in resource descriptions
and other information resources, regardless of the specific domain.
(See §9.2 Structuring Descriptions (page 439))
• Blobs, sets, lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs are all kinds of structures
that can be used to form resource descriptions.
(See §9.2.1 Kinds of Structures (page 442))
• A list, like a set, is a collection of items with an additional constraint: their
items are ordered.
(See §9.2.1.3 Lists (page 443))
• A dictionary, also known as a map or an associative array, is a set of
property-value pairs or entries.
(See §9.2.1.4 Dictionaries (page 444))
• Nested dictionaries form a tree.
(See §9.2.1.4 Dictionaries (page 444))
• Trees consist of nodes joined by edges.
(See §9.2.1.5 Trees (page 445))
• JSON consists of two kinds of structures: lists (called arrays in JavaScript)
and dictionaries (called objects in JavaScript).
(See §9.2.2.1 JSON (page 451))
• The XML Infoset is a tree structure, where each node of the tree is defined
to be an information item of a particular type.
(See §9.2.2.2 XML Information Set (page 451))
• Using schemas to define data representation formats is a good practice that
facilitates shared understanding and contributes to long-term maintainabili­
ty.
(See §9.2.2.2 XML Information Set (page 451))
• The RDF metamodel is a directed graph, so it identifies one node (the one
from which the edge is pointing) as the subject of the triple, and the other
node (the one to which the edge is pointing) as its object. The edge is refer­
red to as the predicate or (as we have been saying) property of the triple.
(See §9.2.2.3 RDF (page 453))

• An “encoding scheme” is a specialized writing system or syntax for particu­
lar types of values. Encoding schemes specify how to textually represent in­
formation.
(See §9.3.1 Notations (page 462))
• A writing system employs notations, and adds a set of rules for using them.
(See §9.3.2 Writing Systems (page 464))
• Differences in ordering demonstrate just one way that multiple writing sys­
tems may use the same notation differently.
(See §9.3.2 Writing Systems (page 464))
• Syntax is the rules that define how characters can be combined into words
and how words can be combined into higher-level structures.
(See §9.3.3 Syntax (page 467))
• The document processing world is concerned primarily with the creation,
processing and management of hybrid narrative-transactional documents.
(See §9.4.1 The Document Processing World (page 471))
• In the web world, documents, data, and services are conceptualized as re­
sources, identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), and accessible
through representations transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP).
(See §9.4.2 The Web World (page 474))
• The Semantic Web world unifies the concept of a resource as it has been de­

It is easy to underestimate the incredible power of the human percep­
tual and cognitive systems to apply neural computation and knowledge to ena­
ble vision and hearing to seem automatic. Computers are getting better at ex­
tracting features from visual and auditory signals to identify and classify inputs,
but our point here is that none of these features are explicitly represented in
the input “blob” or “stream.”

As we commented earlier, an oral description of a resource may not be
especially useful in an organizing system because computers cannot easily un­
derstand it. On the other hand, there are many contexts in which an oral de­
scription would be especially useful, such as in a guided tour of a museum
where visitors can use audio headsets.

[523][Com]

[525][Com]

The XML Information Set (Cowan2004)

RDF/XML is one example where meta models meet. In Document Design Mat­
ters, (Wilde and Glushko 2008b) point out that “If the designer of an exchange
format uses a non-XML conceptual metamodel because it seems to be a better
fit for the data model, XML is only used as the physical layer for the exchange
model. The logical layer in this case defines the mapping between the non-XML
conceptual model, and any reconstruction of the exchange model data requires
the consumer to be fully aware of this mapping. In such a case, it is good prac­
tice to make users of the API aware of the fact that it is using a non-XML meta­
model. Otherwise they might be tempted to base their implementation on a too
small set of examples, creating implementations which are brittle and will fail at
some point in time.”
[526][Com]
Technically, what is described here is referred to as “rooted tree” by
mathematicians, who define trees more generally. Since trees used as data
structures are always rooted trees, we do not make the distinction here.

This feature relies upon the existence of an XML schema. An XML sche­
ma can declare that certain attributes are of type ID, IDREF or IDREFS. Wheth­
er an XML DTD or one of the many schema languages that have been developed

The XML Infoset is one of many metamodels for XML, including the

a well-formed XML document instance. An XML document may also be informed
by its DTD or schema with information about the types of attribute values, and
their default values. Attributes of type ID, IDREF and IDREFs provide a mecha­
nism for intra-document hypertext linking and transclusion. An XML document
instance may contain entity definitions and references that get expanded when
the document is parsed, thereby offering another form of transclusion.
A well-formed XML document instance, when processed, will yield an
XML Information Set, as described here. Information sets may also be construc­
ted by other means, such as transforming from another information set. See the
section on Synthetic Infosets at http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/#intro.syn
thetic for details.
[530][Com]

The Infoset contains knowledge of whether all related declarations have
been read and processed, the base URI of the document instance, information
about attribute types, comments, processing instructions, unparsed entities and
notations, and more.
[531][Com]

A well-formed XML document instance for which there are associated schemas,
such as a DTD, may contribute information to the Infoset. Notably, schemas may
associate data types with element and attribute information items, and it may
also specify default or fixed values for attributes. A DTD may define entities that
are referenced in the document instance and are expanded in-place when pro­
cessed. These contributions can affect the truth value of the document.
The SGML standard explicitly stated that documentation describing or
explaining a DTD is part of the document type definition. The implication being
that a schema is not just about defining syntax, but also semantics. Moreover,
since DTDs do not make possible to describe all possible constraints, such as cooccurrence constraints, the documentation could serve as human-consumable
guidance for implementers as well as content creators and consumers.
[532][Com]

Attribute types may be declared in an XML DTD or schema. Attributes
whose type is ID must have a valid XML name value that is unique within that
XML document; an attribute of type IDREF whose value corresponds to a
unique ID has a “references” property whose value is the element node that cor­
responds to the element with that ID. An attribute of type IDREFS whose value
corresponds to a list of unique ID has a “references” property whose value is a
list of element node(s) that corresponds to the element(s) with matching IDs.

and then it may be referenced in place within the XML document instance. The
entity reference is replaced by the entity value in the XML Infoset. Entities, as
nameable wrappers, effectively disappear on their way into the XML Infoset.

Do not take on the task of creating a new XML model lightly. Literally
thousands of XML vocabularies have been created, and some represent hun­
dreds or thousands of hours of effort. See (Bray 2005) for advice on how to re­
duce the risk of vocabulary design if you cannot find an existing one that satis­
fies your requirements.
[538][Com]

See (Glushko and McGrath 2005) for a synthesis of best practices for
creating domain-specific languages in technical publishing and business-tobusiness document exchange contexts. You need best practices for big prob­
lems, while small ones can be attacked with ad hoc methods.

[539][Com]

Unless an XML instance is associated with a schema, it is fair to say that
it does not have any model at all because there is no way to understand the con­
tent and structure of the information it contains. The assignment of a schema to
an XML instance requires a “Document Type Declaration.” If some of the same
vocabulary terms occur in more than one XML schema, with different meanings
in each, using elements from more than one schema in the same instance re­
quires that they be distinguished using namespaces. For example, if an element
named “title” means the “title of the book” in one schema and “the honorific as­
sociated with a person” in another, instances might have elements with name­
space prefixes like <book:title>The Discipline of Organizing</book:title> and
<hon:title>Professor</hon:title>. Namespaces are a common source of frustra­
tion in XML, because they seem like an overly complicated solution to a simple
problem. But in addition to avoiding naming collisions, they are important in
schema composition and organization.
[540][Com]

What “correctly” means depends on the schema language used to en­
code the conceptual model of the document type. The XML family of standards
includes several schema languages that differ in how completely they can en­
code a document type’s conceptual model. The Document Type Definition (DTD)
has its origins in publishing and enforces structural constraints well; it express­
es strong data typing through associated documentation resources. XML Sche­
ma Definition Language (XSD) is better for representing transactional document
types but its added expressive power tends to make it more complex.

Attribute values can be constrained in a schema by specifying a data
type, a default value, and a list of potential values. Data types allow us to speci­
fy whether a value is supposed to be a name, a number, a date, a token or a
string of text. Having established the data type, we can further constrain the
value of an attribute by specifying a range of values, for a number or a date, for
example. We can also use regular expression patterns to describe a data type
such as a postal code, telephone number or ISBN number. Specifying default
values and lists of legal values for attributes simplifies content creation and
quality assurance processes. In Schematron, a rule-based XML schema lan­
guage for making test assertions about XML documents, we can express con­
straints between elements and attributes in ways that other XML schema lan­
guages cannot. For example, we can express the constraint that if two <title>
elements are provided, then each must contain a unique string value and differ­
ent language attribute values.

Only 95 of these characters are actually “marks” in the sense of being

To add to the confusion, while the American standard (ASCII) places the

Recently, an alternative writing system for XML-structured data has
been standardized: Efficient XML Interchange (EXI). However it is not yet wide­
ly used.

[555][Com]

RDF/XML is a bit confusing; it is a writing system that uses XML syntax
to textually represent RDF structure. This means that while XML tools can read
and write RDF/XML, they cannot manipulate the graph structures it represents,
because they were designed to work with XML’s tree structures.

Although we use alphabetic characters today to represent Roman nu­
merals, originally they were represented by unique symbols.
[557][Ling]

It took a few hundred years before alphabetization became recursive
and applied to letters other than the first (Casson 2002, p. 37). Alphabetization
relies on the ordering of the writing system, not the notation. For example,
Swedish and German are two writing systems that assign different orderings to
the same notation.

For example, the American spelling of the words “center” and “color”
contrasts slightly with the English spelling of “centre” and “colour.” There are
too many examples to include here. Wikipedia has a comprehensive analysis of
American and British spelling differences at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameri
can_and_British_English_spelling_differences.

ASCII’s 128 characters are insufficient to represent these more complex
character sets, so a new family of character encodings was created, ISO-8859,
in which each encoding enumerates 256 characters. Each encoding thus has
more space to accommodate the additional characters of regionally-specific no­
tations. ISO 8859-5, for example, has extensions to support the Cyrillic alpha­
bet.

In discussions of glottic writing systems, “syntax” usually refers only to
the rules for combining words into sentences. In discussions of programming
languages, “syntax” has the broader sense we use here.

[561][Com]

Compound sentences contain two independent clauses joined by a con­
junction, such as “and,” “or,” “nor,” “but.” For example: I went to the store and I
bought a book.” Complex sentences contain an independent clause joined by
one or more dependent clauses. For example: “I read the book that I bought at
the store.”

In truth, even non-glottic writing systems designed to encode resource
descriptions unambiguously can have variant forms of the same statement. For
example, XML permits some variation in the way the same Infoset may be textu­
ally represented. Often these variations involve the treatment of content that
may under some circumstances be treated as optional, such as white space. The
difference is that in writing systems designed for resource description, these
variations can be precisely enumerated and rules developed to reconcile them,
while this is not generally true for glottic writing systems.

It should be noted that the content of the Infoset for a given document
may be affected by knowledge of any related DTDs or schemas. That is to say
that, upon examination of a given XML document instance, its Infoset may be
augmented with some useful information, such as default attribute values and

Microdata is an invention of WHATWG and exists and part of what they

withdrawn from Apple Safari and Google Chrome browsers.

It is worth noting that URIs are not required to have anything at their
endpoints. Resolvability of URIs is evangelized as a best practice for Linked Da­
ta but not a requirement within the broader Semantic Web paradigm. Merely
asserting that a URI is associated with a book is enough. If the URI can return a
description or a resource, so much the better, but if not, at least you can talk
about the book by referring to the same URI.

10.1 Introduction
Picture a dim room in the basement of a Detroit police station, lined with metal
shelves: the shelves contain boxes and boxes of cold case files, evidence meticu­
lously logged and categorized for no one to look at, documenting murders that
will never be solved. Or the library of a small-town historical society in New Jer­
sey: struggling with budget cuts, the board of directors has been forced to close
its doors, locking its treasures inside, carefully curated and preserved but inac­
cessible to the public. Or a valuable data store encoded in an orphaned storage
format: business records in a legacy database system that will not run on mod­
ern computers, census data on proprietary magnetic tape reels from the 1970s,
your unfinished novel on a series of eight-inch floppy disks. You know the data is
there, but you cannot interact with it.

The Discipline of Organizing

An organizing system without interactions is a sad one indeed.
Interactions are the answer to two of the fundamental questions we posed back
in Chapter 1: why and when are the resources organized?
The question of “why?” has been in the background (and often the foreground)
of every chapter in this book thus far; whenever we select a resource for inclu­
sion in an organizing system, describe it, or arrange it according to an organiz­
ing principle, we have an interaction in mind. We include a resource in our sys­
tem because our users will need it; we assign a resource to one or more catego­
ries to help our users find it, understand it, and connect it with other resources
in a meaningful way.
In this chapter we will pivot from design for interactions to the design of inter­
actions—and to do this we must pause to consider the question of “when?” In
§2.5, we contrasted organization done “on the way in” with that done “on the
way out,” but this distinction is not always a particularly relevant one. Consider
a bookshelf: if you do not organize its resources on the way in (i.e., when you
put a book on the shelf), you cannot really organize them on the way out; you
just have a disorganized bookshelf. When the time comes to retrieve a book,
you'll have to employ a brute-force linear search algorithm—reading every spine
until you find the one you want, and it will not make the remaining books on the
shelf any more organized.
But digital resources and networked organizing systems are an entirely differ­
ent story. In fact, we argue that they blur the traditional boundary between the
academic disciplines of “information organization” and “information retrieval”;
with the World Wide Web, ubiquitous digital information, and effectively unlimi­
ted processing, storage, and communication capability driven by cloud comput­
ing architecture and Moore’s law, billions of people create and browse websites,
blog, tag, tweet, and upload and download content of all media types without
thinking “I am organizing now” or “I am retrieving now.” When people use their
smartphones to search the web or run applications, location information trans­
mitted from their phone is used to filter and reorganize the information they re­
trieve. Arranging results to make them fit the user’s location is a kind of compu­
tational curation, but because it takes place quickly and automatically we hardly
notice it. Likewise, almost every application that once seemed predominantly
about information retrieval is now increasingly combined with activities and
functions that most would consider to be information organization.
Thus we come to the question of when a system's resources are organized: we
may apply the techniques of computational information retrieval to a set of re­
sources that simply are not organized the way we need them to be in order to
support our desired interaction. Maybe the system was designed poorly or for a
different purpose than the one we are pursuing; maybe we are attempting to
collect or aggregate resources from multiple organizing systems, each of which
488

has its own separate purposes and design flaws. Regardless of the reasons,
what we are essentially doing is reorganizing these resources on the fly, or “on
the way out,” following many of the same principles and procedures we've cov­
ered in the preceding eight chapters of this book.

Most Common Museum Interaction

Because museums often contain extremely rare or valuable resources that
do not circulate, their most popular items are mobbed by visitors. The
crowding often makes it impossible to get a good look at the rare item. This
ironic situation is typified by the crowd control cordon that creates a 20foot barrier around La Gioconda (aka “The Mona Lisa”) at Musée du Louvre
in Paris.

The fundamental interaction of any organizing system is accessing resources or
resource descriptions, whether physically or digitally. Sometimes we must com­
bine or merge resources or resource descriptions to access them effectively;
this poses numerous strategy, design, and implementation challenges, as pro­
ducers often use different identifiers, description or cataloging formats, and
practices for similar resources. Different service providers use different technol­

ogies, have different information policies, and follow different processes devel­
oped in their separate organizing systems.
Some organizing systems have the power to determine the description stand­
ards that others must use. Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States,
has devised an organizing system for its supply chain that supports access and
movement of physical goods with maximal efficiency and effectiveness. This sys­
tem saves the corporation money on inventory management and distribution,
but to maximize savings, Walmart requires its suppliers to employ the same da­
ta model, follow company-set standards, and adopt new technologies such as
bar codes and RFID tags that support the highly efficient interactions it re­
quires.572[Bus]

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

Still others choose to abide by what a standard-setting body decides, or partici­
pate in laborious, democratic processes to align their organizing practices and
interactions.573[Bus] Libraries and museums are the classic examples of this. The
most important interaction in a library, of course, is borrowing: checking out a
book to use it off the premises, and checking it back in when you're done. Pa­
trons search descriptions in a catalog to find books on a certain topic, by a cer­
tain author, or with a certain title, and access them by fetching them from the
stacks or asking a librarian to retrieve them. As institutions that serve the pub­
lic interest, libraries adhere to standards and democratic processes to ensure
consistent and familiar user experiences for patrons, but also to enable power­
ful search interactions such as union catalogs, where resource descriptions
from multiple libraries are merged before they are offered for search. Union
catalogs allow patrons to find out with a single search whether a resource is
available from any library that is accessible to them.
Museums serve the public interest as well, and employ standards and democrat­
ic procedures for similar reasons as libraries, but their visitors generally look at
their resources rather than borrowing them. Museums enable people to discov­
er or experience resources by exhibiting artifacts in creative contexts, and when
they implement this interaction digitally, as in a website, they vastly increase
the opportunity for public access. Virtual collections are accessible to remote
patrons who are unable to visit the physical museum, and they allow access to
resources that are not currently on view.
The digitization of museum resources also allows visitors to experience them
from a perspective that might not be possible in a physical museum. For exam­
ple, in Google’s Art Project, users can zoom in to view fine details of digitized
paintings. Museums are starting to leverage technology and the popularity of
Web 2.0 features such as tagging and social networking to attract new audien­
ces.
Implemented in 2004, the MuseumFinland project aims to provide a portal for
publishing heterogeneous museum collections on the Semantic Web. Institu­
tions such as the Getty Information Institute and the International Committee
for Documentation of the International Council of Museums have worked on
standards that ensure worldwide consistency in how museums manage informa­
tion about their collections.
How can these differences be handled in order to provide seamless interactions
within and across organizing systems? Which requirements have to be met in
order to provide the interactions that are desired? How are different interaction
types implemented? Finally, how can the quality of interactions be evaluated
with respect to their requirements? These are the main questions for interac­
tions that we will try to answer.

10.1 Introduction

491

The Discipline of Organizing

Navigating This Chapter
This chapter concentrates on the processes that develop interactions
based on leveraging the resources of organizing systems to provide
valuable services to their users (human or computational agents). It
will discuss the determination of the appropriate interactions (§10.2),
the organization of resources for interactions (§10.3), the implemen­
tation of interactions (§10.4), and their evaluation and adaptation
(§10.5). Although the fundamental questions pertain to all types of
organizing systems, this chapter focuses on systems that use comput­
ers to satisfy their goals.

10.2 Determining Interactions
Creating a strategy for successfully implementing interactions involves an intri­
cate balance between the resources, the organizing system that arranges and
manages them, its producers, and its intended users or consumers. The design
of interactions is driven by user requirements and their impact on the choices
made in the implementation process. It is constrained by resource and technical
system properties and by social and legal requirements. Determining the scope
and scale of interactions requires a careful analysis of these individual factors,
their combination, and the consequences thereof.

Stop and Think: Constraint vs
Flexibility
Think of an information organiza­
tion project you were involved in.
Can you recall ways in which you
were constrained in representing
an idea by the organizing system
the project was implemented with?
In what ways was the project nega­
tively affected by the implementa­
tion? In what ways might the con­
straint have had a positive effect?

It is useful to distinguish decisions
that involve choices, where multiple
feasible alternatives exist, from deci­
sions that involve constraints, where
design choices have been eliminated
or rendered infeasible by previous
ones. The goal when creating an or­
ganizing system is to make design de­
cisions that preserve subsequent
choices or that create constraints that
impose design decisions that would
have been preferred anyway.

10.2.1 User Requirements

Users (human or computational agents) search or navigate resources in organiz­
ing systems not just to identify them, but also to obtain and further use the se­
lected resources (e.g., read, cluster, annotate, buy, copy, distribute, adapt, etc.).
How resources are used and by whom affects how much of the resource or its

492

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

description is exposed, across which channels it is offered, and the precision
and accuracy of the interaction.
An organizing system should enable interactions that allow users to achieve
their goals. The more abstract and intermediated the interaction between a user
and an organizing system becomes, the more precisely the requirements must
be expressed. User requirements can be stated or implied, depending on the so­
phistication and functional capabilities of the system.
In a closet, which is a personal organizing system for physical resources, the
person searching with an intent to find a particular shirt might think, “Where is
my yellow Hawaiian shirt?” but does not need to communicate the search crite­
ria to anyone else in an explicit way. In a business or institutional organizing
system, however, the user needs to describe the desired resource and interact
with the system to select from candidate resources. This interaction might in­
volve a human intermediary like a salesperson or reference librarian, or a com­
putational one like a search engine.
A user’s information need usually determines the kind and content of resources
required. User information needs are most often expressed in search queries
(whatever is typed into a search box) or manifest themselves in the selection of
one or more of the system categories that are offered for browsing. Queries can
be as simple as a few keywords or very complex and specialized, employing dif­
ferent search fields or operators; they may even be expressed in a query lan­
guage by expert users. Techniques such as spelling correction, query expansion,
and suggestion assist users in formulating queries. Techniques like breadcrumb
navigation and faceted filtering assist users in browsing an organizing system’s
category system. Some systems allow the query to be expressed in natural lan­
guage and then transform it into a description that is easier for the system to
process. Queries for non-textual information like photos or videos are typically
expressed as text, but some systems compute descriptions from non-textual
queries such as images or audio files. For example, a user can hum a tune or
draw or drag an image into an image query box.
Information needs of computational agents are determined by rules and criteria
set by the creators of the agents (i.e., the function or goal of the agent). When a
computational agent interacts with another computational agent or service by
using its API, in the ideal case its output precisely satisfies those information
needs.
While search queries are explicitly stated user information needs, organizing
systems increasingly attempt to solicit the user’s context or larger work task in
order to provide more suitable or precise interactions. Factors such as level of
education, physical disabilities, location, time, or deadline pressure often speci­
fy and constrain the types of resources needed as well as the types of interac­
tions the user is willing or able to engage in. Implicit information can be col­

lected from user behavior, for example, search or buying history, current user
location or language, and social or collaborative behavior (other people with the
same context). Methods for explicitly soliciting user requirements include ob­
servation, surveys, focus groups, interviews, work task analysis and many
more.579[IA]
Designers of organizing systems must recognize that people are not perfectly
capable and rational decision makers. Limited memory and attention capacities
prevent people from remembering everything and make them unable to consid­
er more than a few things or choices at once. As a result of these fundamental
limitations, people consciously and unconsciously reduce the cognitive effort
they make when faced with decisions.
One important way in which this affects how people behave demonstrates what
Barry Schwartz calls The Paradox of Choice. You might think that people would
prefer many options rather than just a few because that would better enable
them to select a resource that best meets their requirements. In fact, because
considering more choices requires more mental effort, this can cause stress and
indecision and might cause people to give up. For example, when there were 24
different types of jam offered at an upscale market, more people stopped to
494

Behavioral Economics
Classical economics assumes that humans are perfectly rational goaloriented actors who act to achieve maximal satisfaction or utility. In con­
trast, behavioral economics recognizes the cognitive and emotional con­
straints on human behavior and assumes that people are biased and flawed
decision makers.
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky systematized the psychological founda­
tions for behavioral economics, building on the work of Herbert Simon, who
first proposed to understand people as “boundedly rational.” Kahneman and
Tversky identified the systematic biases that prevent people from making
optimal decisions and the heuristics they use to save cognitive effort. Kah­
neman contrasts classical and behavioral economics as follows:
Psychological theories of intuitive thinking cannot match the elegance and
precision of formal normative models of belief and choice, but this is just an­
other way of saying that rational models are psychologically unrealistic.

— (Kahneman 2003, p 1449)

Sunstein and Thaler popularized the application of behavioral economics as
“libertarian paternalism,” with the goal of encouraging the design of organ­
izing systems and policies that maintain or increase freedom of choice but
which at the same time influence people to make choices that they would
judge as good ones. This perspective is nicely captured by the title of their
best-selling book, Nudge. Many government agencies and businesses in the
US and elsewhere are building “nudging” principles into policies and prod­
ucts in the areas of social services, healthcare, and financial services be­
cause of the complexity of their offerings.
Behavioral economics complements the discipline of organizing by offering
insights into the thinking and behavior of typical users that can lead to clas­
sifications and choices that make them more effective and satisfied. Howev­
er, the principles of behavioral economics can be used to design organizing
systems that manipulate people into taking actions and making choices that
they might not intend or that are not in their best interests. (See Dark Pat­
terns (page 112).)582[CogSci]
taste than when only 6 choices were offered, but a greater percentage of people
who were presented a smaller number of options actually made a pur­
chase.580[CogSci]
We see the same phenomenon when we compare libraries and bookstores. A ra­
tional book seeker should prefer the detailed classification system used in libra­
ries over the very coarse BISAC system used in bookstores. However, many peo­
10.2 Determining Interactions

495

The Discipline of Organizing

ple say that the detailed system makes them work too hard, leading to calls that
new libraries adopt the bookstore organizing system. (See §8.3.3)
People can avoid making choices if a system proposes or pre-selects an option
for them that becomes a default choice if they do nothing. Often people will
make a cursory assessment about how well the option satisfies a requirement
and if it is good enough they will not consider any other alternatives.581[Law]
The study of the limits to human rationality in decision-making is the center­
piece of the discipline known as Behavioral Economics (page 495).
Organizing systems should plan for interactions based on non-purposeful user
behavior. A user who does not have a particular resource need in mind might in­
teract with an organizing system to see what it contains or to be entertained or
educated. Imagine a user going to a museum to avoid the heat outside. Their re­
quirement is to be out of the heat and—possibly—to see interesting things. A
visitor to a zoo might go there to view a specific animal, but most of the time,
visitors follow a more or less random path among the zoo’s resources. Similarly,
web surfing is random, non-information-need-driven behavior. This type of re­
quirement cannot be satisfied by providing search capabilities alone; other in­
teraction types (e.g., browsing, suggestions) must be provided as well.
Lastly, not all users are human beings, typing in search queries or browsing
through catalogs. An organizing system should plan for interaction scenarios
where computational agents access the system via APIs (application program­
ming interfaces), which require heavily standardized access procedures and re­
source descriptions in order to enable interactions.

10.2.2 Socio-Political and Organizational Constraints
An important constraint for interaction design choices is the access policies im­
posed by the producers of organizing systems, as already described in §3.4.3 Ac­
cess Policies (page 131). If resources or their descriptions are restricted, inter­
actions may not be able to use certain properties and therefore cannot be sup­
ported.
Inter-organizational or socio-political constraints are imposed when certain par­
ties in an interaction, or even producers of an organizing system, can exert pow­
er over other parties and therefore control the nature of the interaction (or even
the nature of the resource descriptions). We can distinguish different types of
constraints:
Information and economic power asymmetry
Some organizations are able to impose their requirements for interactions
and their resource description formats upon their clients or customers. For
example, Google and Apple each have the power to control the extent of in­
teroperability attainable in products, services, or applications that utilize
496

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

their numerous platforms through mandated APIs and the process by which
third-party applications are approved. The asymmetry between these domi­
nant players and the myriad of smaller entities providing peripheral support,
services, or components can result in de facto standards that may pose sig­
nificant burden for small businesses and reduce overall competition.
Standards
Industry-wide or community standards can be essential in enabling intero­
perability between systems, applications, and devices. A standard interface
describes the data formats and protocols to which systems should con­
form.583[Com] Failure to adhere to standards complicates the merging of re­
sources from different organizing systems. Challenges to standardization in­
clude organizational inertia; closed policies, processes, or development
groups; intellectual property; credentialing; lack of specifications; compet­
ing standards; high implementation costs; lack of conformance metrics; lack
of clarity or awareness; and abuse of standards as trade barriers.
Public policy
Beyond businesses and standards-setting organizations, the government sec­
tor wields substantial influence over the implementation and success of pos­
sible interactions in organizing systems. As institutions with large and inal­
ienable constituents, governments and governmental entities have similar
influences as large businesses due to their size and substantial impact over
society at large. Different forms of government around the world, ranging
from centrally planned autocracy to loosely organized nation-states, can
have far-reaching consequences in terms of how resource description poli­
cies are designed. Laws and regulations regarding data privacy prevent or­
ganizing systems from recording certain user data, therefore prohibiting in­
teractions based on this information.584[Bus]
Even within the same firm or organi­
zation, constraints on interaction de­
sign may result from contradictory
policies for organizing systems or
even require the implementation of
separate, disjoint systems that cannot
be integrated without additional in­
vestment. Siloed business functions
may be resistant to the merging of re­
sources or resource descriptions in

10.2 Determining Interactions

497

The Discipline of Organizing

Often characterized by different kinds of value contribution, different policies,
processes, and practices, organizational units must clearly define and prioritize
different interaction goals, align and coordinate processes, and build collabora­
tion capabilities to achieve a high level of interoperability within the organizing
system or between different organizing systems in the organization.
In addition to information exchange, organizational interoperability also aims to
provide services that are widely available, easily identifiable, and accessible
across the enterprise.
Nevertheless, inter-organizational constraints are inherently less deterministic
than intra-organizational ones, because it is possible that a decision-maker with
broad authority can decide that some interaction is important enough to war­
rant the change of institutional policies, formats, or even category systems. (See
§7.2.3 Institutional Categories (page 331).)

Regulatory Constraints: Right to be Forgotten
A controversial idea known as the “right to be forgotten” gained the force of
law in the European Union in May 2014 after the EU's highest court ruled
that people could ask search engines such as Google, which dominates the
European market, to remove certain kinds of personal information from
their search results.
The ruling had its foundations in the EU's 1995 Data Protection Directive, a
data retention policy crafted in a time before the dominance of the Internet
and search engines. While many privacy advocates hailed it as a victory, oth­
ers in the technology and media firms have decried it as censorship. Either
way, it has highlighted the need for the European Commission to update
and modernize its data policy; a proposal has been before the European Par­
liament since 2012, and plans for its adoption were underway as of summer
2014. (Source: EC fact sheet on the “right to be forgotten” ruling.)

10.3 Reorganizing Resources for Interactions
Once the scope and range of interactions is defined according to requirements
and constraints, the resources and the technology of the organizing system have
to be arranged to enable the implementation of the desired interactions.
Commonly, interactions are determined at the beginning of a development proc­
ess of the organizing system. It follows that most required resource descriptions
(which properties of a resource are documented in an organizing system) need
to be clarified at the beginning of the development process as well; that is, re­
source descriptions are determined based on the desired interactions that an or­
ganizing system should support. Most of these processes have been described in
detail in Chapter 5, Chapter 6 and Chapter 9.
Resources from different organizing systems are often aggregated to be ac­
cessed within one larger organizing system (warehouses, portals, search en­
gines, union catalogs, cross-brand retailers), which requires resources and re­
source descriptions to be transformed in order to adapt to the new organizing
system with its extended interaction requirements. Elsewhere, legacy systems
often need to be updated to accommodate new standards, technologies, and in­
teractions (e.g, mobile interfaces for digital libraries). That means that the nec­
essary resources and resource descriptions for an interaction need to be identi­
fied, and, if necessary, changes have to be made in the description of the resour­
ces. Sometimes, resources are merged or transformed in order to perform new
interactions.

10.3.1 Identifying and Describing Resources for Interactions
Individual and collection resource descriptions need to be carefully considered
in order to record the necessary information for the designed interactions. (See
Chapter 9.) The type of interaction determines whether new properties need to
be derived or computed with the help of external factors and whether these
properties will be represented permanently in the organizing system (e.g., an
extended topical description added due to a user comment) or created on the fly
whenever a transaction is executed (e.g., a frequency count).
Determining which resources or resource descriptions will be used in an inter­
action is simple when all resources are included (e.g., in a simple search inter­
action over all resources in a data warehouse). Sometimes resources need to be
identified according to more selective criteria such as resources exhibiting a
certain property (e.g., all restaurants in your neighborhood with four stars on
Yelp in an advanced search interaction).

10.3.2 Transforming Resources for Interactions
When an organizing system and its interactions are designed with resources or
resource descriptions from legacy systems with outdated formats or from multi­
ple organizing systems or when the new organizing systems has a different pur­
pose and requires different resource properties, resources and their descrip­
tions need to be transformed. The processing and transformation steps required
to produce the expected modification can be applied at different layers:
Infrastructure or notation transformation
When resources are aggregated, the organizing systems must have a com­
mon basic infrastructure to communicate with one another and speak the
same language. This means that participating systems must have a common
set of communication protocols and an agreed upon way of representing in­
formation in digital formats, i.e., a notation (§9.3.1), such as the Unicode en­
coding scheme.586[Com]
Writing system transformation
During a writing system transformation (Chapter 9), the syntax or vocabu­
lary—also called the data exchange format—of the resource description will
be changed to conform to another model, e.g., when library records are
mapped from the MARC21 standard to the Dublin Core format in order to be
aggregated, or when information in a business information system is trans­
formed into an EDI or XML format so that it can be sent to another
firm.587[Bus] Sometimes customized vocabularies are used to represent certain
types of properties. These vocabularies were probably introduced to reduce
errors or ambiguity or abbreviate common organizational resource proper­
ties. These customized vocabularies need to be explained and agreed upon
by organizations combining resources to prevent interoperability problems.
Semantic transformation
Agreeing on a category or classification system (Chapter 7 & Chapter 8) is
crucial so that organizing systems agree semantically—that is, so that re­
source properties and descriptions share not only technology but also mean­
ing. For example, because the US Census has often changed its system of
race categories, it is difficult to compare data from different censuses with­
out some semantic transformation to align the categories.588[Com]
Resource or resource description transformation
Resources or resource descriptions are often directly transformed, as when
they are converted to another file format. In computer-based interactions
like search engines, text resources are often pre-processed to remove some
of the ambiguity inherent in natural language. These steps, collectively
called text processing, include decoding, filtering, normalization, stopword
elimination, and stemming. (See the sidebar, Text Processing (page 501))

500

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

Text Processing
Decoding
A digital resource is first a sequence of bits. Decoding transforms those
bits into characters according to the encoding scheme used, extracting
the text from its stored form. (See §9.3.1 Notations (page 462).)
Filtering
If a text is encapsulated by formatting or non-semantic markup, these
characters are removed because this information is rarely used as the
basis of further interactions.
Tokenization
Segments the stream of characters (in an encoding scheme, a space is
also a character) into textual components, usually words. In English, a
simple rule-based system can separate words using spaces. However,
punctuation makes things more complicated. For example, periods at
the end of sentences should be removed, but periods in numbers should
not. Other languages introduce other problems for tokenization; in Chi­
nese, a space does not mark the divisions between individual concepts.
Normalization
Normalization removes superficial differences in character sequences,
for example, by transforming all capitalized characters into lower-case.
More complicated normalization operations include the removal of ac­
cents, hyphens, or diacritics and merging different forms of acronyms
(e.g., U.N. and UN are both normalized to UN).
Stopword elimination
Stopwords are those words in a language that occur very frequently and
are not very semantically expressive. Stopwords are usually articles,
pronouns, prepositions, or conjunctions. Since they occur in every text,
they can be removed because they cannot distinguish them. Of course,
in some cases, removing stopwords might remove semantically impor­
tant phrases (e.g., “To be or not to be”).
Stemming
These processing steps normalize inflectional and derivational variations
in terms, e.g., by removing the “-ed” from verbs in the past tense. This
homogenization can be done by following rules (stemming) or by using
dictionaries (lemmatization). Rule-based stemming algorithms are easy
to implement, but can result in wrongly normalized word groups, for ex­
ample when “university” and “universe” are both stemmed to “univers.”

The Discipline of Organizing

10.3.2.1 Transforming Resources from Multiple or Legacy Organizing
Systems
The traditional approach to enabling heterogeneous organizing systems to be
accessed together has been to fully integrate them, which has allowed the “un­
restricted sharing of data and business processes among any connected applica­
tions and data sources” in the organization.589[Bus] This can be a strategic ap­
proach to improving the management of resources, resource descriptions, and
organizing systems as a whole, especially when organizations have disparate
systems and redundant information spread across different groups and depart­
ments. However, it can also be a costly approach, as integration points may be
numerous, with vastly different technologies needed to get one system to inte­
grate with another. Maintenance also becomes an issue, as changes in one sys­
tem may entail changes in all systems integrating with it.590[Bus]
Planning the transformation of resources from different organizing systems to
be merged in an aggregation is called data mapping or alignment. In this proc­
ess, aspects of the description layers (most often writing system or semantics)
are compared and matched between two or more organizing systems. The rela­
tionship between each component may be unidirectional or bidirectional. In ad­
dition, resource properties and values that are semantically equivalent might
have different names (the vocabulary problem of §4.4.2.1). The purpose of map­
ping may vary from allowing simple exchanges of resource descriptions, to ena­
bling access to longitudinal data, to facilitating standardized reporting.592[Com]
The preservation of version histories of resource description elements and rela­
tions in both systems is vital for verifying the validity of the data map.
Similar to mapping, a straightforward approach to transformation is the use of
crosswalks, which are equivalence tables that relate resource description ele­
ments, semantics, and writing systems from one organizing system to those of
another.593[Com] Crosswalks not only enable systems with different resource de­
scriptions to interchange information in real-time, but are also used by thirdparty systems, such as harvesters and search engines to generate union cata­
logs and perform queries on multiple systems as if they were one consolidated
system.594[Com]
As the number of organizing systems increases, crosswalks and mappings be­
come increasingly impractical if each pair of organizing systems requires a sep­
arate crosswalk. A more efficient approach would be the use of one vocabulary
or format as a switching mechanism (also called a pivot or hub language) for all
other vocabularies to map towards. Another possibility, which is often used in
asymmetric power relationships between organizing systems, is to force all sys­
tems to adhere to the format that is used by the most powerful party.

10.3.2.2 Modes of Transformation
The conceptual relationships between different descriptions can be mapped out
manually when creating simple maps. This, however, becomes more difficult as
maps become more complex, due to the number of properties being mapped or
when there are more structural or granularity issues to consider.
The use of automatic tools to create these alignments become vital in ensuring
their accuracy and robustness. Graphical mapping tools provide users with a
graphical user interface to connect description elements from source to target
by drawing a line from one to the other.600[Com] Other tools perform automatic
mappings based on predetermined rules and criteria.601[Com]
We often perform manual run-time transformations for decisions that require
consulting more than one organizing system in our daily lives. For example,
when planning a vacation, we use a variety of systems to negotiate a wide set of
ad hoc requirements such as our resources and time, our fellow travelers and
their availability, and the bookings for hotel and transportation, as well as desir­
able destinations and their various offerings. We somehow reconcile the differ­
ent descriptions used in each of the systems and match these against each other
so that the relevant information can be combined and compared. Even though
the systems use different formats, vocabularies and structures, they are targe­
ted toward human users and are relatively easy to interpret. For automatic runtime transformations, which need to be handled computationally, designers face
the challenge of creating more structured processes for merging information
from different systems.602[Com]
The time of the transformation—at design time when organizing system resour­
ces are merged, or at run time when a certain interaction is performed— de­
pends on the nature of the collaboration between organizing systems. Designtime transformations depend on highly cooperative environments where specific
design requirements (like mapping rules and criteria) can be negotiated ahead
of the system implementation. In cases where high-flexibility, ad hoc or realtime transformations would not be possible due to a lack of cooperation (such as
the ShopStyle.com), run-time transformation processes may provide appropriate
alternatives. Some low-level incompatibilities between organizing systems, such
as the presence of syntactical, encoding, and particular structural and content
issues, can also be rectified by implementing run-time transformation techni­
ques, creating more loosely-coupled interoperating systems.

10.3.2.3 Granularity and Abstraction
Within writing system and semantic transformations, issues of granularity and
level of abstraction (§5.3.1 Determining the Scope and Focus (page 230) and
§7.4.1 Category Abstraction and Granularity (page 356)) pose the most challeng­
es to cross-organizing system interoperability.603[Com] Granularity refers to the
10.3 Reorganizing Resources for Interactions

503

The Discipline of Organizing

level of detail or precision for a specific information resource property. For in­
stance, the postal address of a particular location might be represented as sev­
eral different data items, including the number, street name, city, state, country
and postal code (a high-granularity model). It might also be represented in one
single line including all of the information above (a low-granularity model).
While it is easy to create the complete address by aggregating the different in­
formation components from the high-granularity model, it is not as easy to de­
compose the low-granularity model into more specific information components.
This does not mean, however, that a high-granularity model is always the best
choice, especially if the context of use does not require it, as there are corre­
sponding tradeoffs in terms of efficiency and speed in assembling and process­
ing the resource information. (See the sidebar, AccuWeather Request Granularity
(page 504))
The level of abstraction is the degree to which a resource description is abstrac­
ted from the concrete use case in order to fit a wider range of resources. For ex­
ample, many countries have an address field called state, but in some countries,
a similar regional division is called province. In order to accommodate both con­
cepts, we can abstract from the original concrete concepts and establish a more
abstract description of administrative region. Granularity and abstraction differ­
ences can occur at every resource property layer when resources need to be
transformed; therefore, they need to be recognized and analyzed at every layer.

AccuWeather Request Granularity
Requests for AccuWeather data have exploded in the last years, due to auto­
mated requests from mobile devices to keep weather apps updated. The
company has dealt with this challenge by truncating the GPS coordinates
sent by the mobile device when it requests weather data (a transformation
to lower granularity). If the request with the truncated coordinates is identi­
cal to one recently made, a cached version of the content is served, result­
ing in 300 million to 500 million fewer requests a day.604[Com]

10.3.2.4 Accuracy of Transformations
Automatic mapping tools can only be as accurate as the specifications and crite­
ria that are included in the mapping guidelines. Intellectual checks and tests
performed by humans are almost always necessary to validate the accuracy of
the transformation. Because description systems vary in expressive power and
complexity, challenges to transformations may arise from differences in seman­
tic definitions, rules regarding whether an element is required or requires mul­
tiple values, hierarchical or value constraints, and controlled vocabularies. As a
result of these complexities, absolute transformations that ensure exact map­

504

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

pings will result in a loss of precision if the source description system is sub­
stantially richer than the target system.
In practice, relative crosswalks where all elements in a source description are
mapped to at least one target, regardless of semantic equivalence, are often im­
plemented. This lowers the quality and accuracy of the mapping and can result
in “down translation” or “dumbing down” of the system for resource descrip­
tion. As a result of mapping compromises due to different granularity or ab­
straction levels, transformations from different organizing systems usually re­
sult in less granular or specific resource descriptions. Consequently, whereas
some interactions are now enabled (e.g., cross-organizing system search), oth­
ers that were once possible can no longer be supported. For example, conflating
geographical and person subject fields from one system (e.g., geographical sub­
ject = Alberta, person subject = Virginia) to a joint subject field (e.g. subject =
Alberta, Virginia) to transform to the resource description of another system
does not allow for searches that distinguish between these specific categories
anymore.

guage processing interactions (e.g., named entity recognition, summarization,
sentiment analysis, anaphoric resolution). Another way to distinguish among in­
teractions is to note whether resources are changed during the interaction (e.g.,
annotate, tag, rate, comment) or unchanged (search, cluster). Yet another way
would be to distinguish interactions based on their absolute and relative com­
plexity, i.e., on the progression of actions or steps that are needed to complete
the interaction. Here, we will distinguish interactions based on the different re­
source description layers they act upon.
Chapter 3, Activities in Organizing Systems, introduced the concept of afford­
ance or behavioral repertoire—the inherent actionable properties that deter­
mine what can be done with resources. We will now look at affordances (and
constraints) that resource properties pose for interaction design. The interac­
tions that an individual resource can support depend on the nature and extent

10.4 Implementing Interactions

505

The Discipline of Organizing

of its inherent and described properties and internal structure. However, the in­
teractions that can be designed into an organizing system can be extended by
utilizing collection properties, derived properties, and any combination thereof.
These three types of resource properties can be thought of as creating layers
because they build on each other.
The further an organizing system moves up the layers, the more functional ca­
pabilities are enabled and more interactions can be designed. The degree of
possible interactions is determined by the extent of the properties that are or­
ganized, described, and created in an organizing system. This marks a correla­
tion between the extent of organization and the range of possible interactions:
The more extensive the organization and the number of identifiable resource
properties, the larger the universe of “affordable” interactions.
Interactions can be distinguished by four layers:
Interactions based on properties of individual resources
Resource properties have been described extensively in Chapter 4 and Chap­
ter 5. Any information or property that describes the resource itself can be
used to design an interaction. If a property is not described in an organizing
system or does not pertain to certain resources, an interaction that needs
this information cannot be implemented. For example, a retail site like Shop­
style cannot offer to reliably search by color of clothing if this property is not
contained in the resource description.
Interactions based on collection properties
Collection-based properties are created when resources are aggregated.
(See Chapter 1.) An interaction that compares individual resources to a col­
lection average (e.g., average age of publications in a library or average
price of goods in a retail store) can only be implemented if the collection
average is calculated.
Interactions based on derived or computed properties
Derived or computed properties are not inherent in the resources or collec­
tions but need to be computed with the help of external information or tools.
The popularity of a digital resource can be computed based on the frequency
of its use, for example. This computed property could then be used to design
an access interaction that searches resources based on their popularity. An
important use case for derived properties is the analysis of non-textual re­
sources like images or audio files. For these content-based interactions, in­
trinsic properties of the resources like color distributions are computational­
ly derived and stored as resource properties. A search can then be per­
formed on color distributions (e.g., a search for outdoor nature images could
return resources that have a high concentration of blue in the upper half
and a high concentration of green on the bottom: a meadow on a sunny day).

506

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

Interactions based on combining resources
Combining resources and their individual, collection or derived properties
can be used to design interactions based on joint properties that a single or­
ganizing system and its resources do not contain. This can lead to interac­
tions that individual organizing systems with their particular purposes and
resource descriptions cannot offer.
Whether a desired interaction can be implemented depends on the layers of re­
source properties that have been incorporated into the organizing system. How
an interaction is implemented (especially in digital organizing systems) depends
also on the algorithms and technologies available to access the resources or re­
source descriptions.
In our examples, we write primarily about textual resources or resource de­
scriptions. Information retrieval of physical goods (e.g., finding a favorite cookie
brand in the supermarket) or non-textual multimedia digital resources (e.g.,
finding images of the UC Berkeley logo) involves similar interactions, but with
different algorithms and different resource properties.

10.4.1 Interactions Based on Instance Properties
Interactions in this category depend only on the properties of individual re­
source instances. Often, using resource properties on this lower layer coincides
with basic action combinations in the interaction.

10.4.1.1 Boolean Retrieval
In a Boolean search, a query is specified by stating the information need and us­
ing operators from Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) to combine the components.
The query is compared to individual resource properties (most often terms),
where the result of the comparison is either TRUE or FALSE. The TRUE results
are returned as a result of the query, and all other results are ignored. A Boo­
lean search does not compare or rank resources so every returned resource is
considered equally relevant. The advantage of the Boolean search is that the re­
sults are predictable and easy to explain. However, because the results of the
Boolean model are not ranked by relevance, users have to sift through all the
returned resource descriptions in order to find the most useful re­
sults.606[Com] 607[Com]

10.4.1.2 Tag / Annotate
A tagging or annotation interaction allows a user (either a human or a computa­
tional agent) to add information to the resource itself or the resource descrip­
tions. A typical tagging or annotation interaction locates a resource or resource
description and lets the user add their chosen resource property. The resulting
changes are stored in the organizing system and can be made available for oth­
10.4 Implementing Interactions

507

The Discipline of Organizing

er interactions (e.g., when additional tags are used to improve the search). An
interaction that adds information from users can also enhance the quality of the
system and improve its usability.

10.4.2 Interactions Based on Collection Properties
Interactions in this category utilize collection-level properties in order to im­
prove the interaction, for example, to improve the ranking in a search or to ena­
ble comparison to collection averages.

10.4.2.1 Ranked Retrieval with Vector Space or Probabilistic Models
Ranked retrieval sorts the results of a search according to their relevance with
respect to the information need expressed in a query. The Vector Space and
Probabilistic approaches introduced here use individual resource properties like
term occurrence or term frequency in a resource and collection averages of
terms and their frequencies to calculate the rank of a resource for a
query.609[Com]
The simplicity of the Boolean model makes it easy to understand and imple­
ment, but its binary notion of relevance does not fit our intuition that terms dif­
fer in how much they suggest what a document is about. Gerard Salton invented
the vector space model of information retrieval to enable a continuous measure
of relevance.610[Com] In the vector space model, each resource and query in an or­
ganizing system is represented as a vector of terms. Resources and queries are
compared by comparing the directions of vectors in an n-dimensional space (as
many dimensions as terms in the collection), with the assumption is that “close­
ness in space” means “closeness in meaning.”
In contrast to the vector space model, the underlying idea of the probabilistic
model is that given a query and a resource or resource description (most often a
text), probability theory is used to estimate how likely it is that a resource is rel­
evant to an information need. A probabilistic model returns a list of resources
that are ranked by their estimated probability of relevance with respect to the
information need so that the resource with the highest probability to be relevant
is ranked highest. In the vector space model, by comparison, the resource
whose term vector is most similar to a query term vector (based on frequency
counts) is ranked highest.611[Com]
Both models utilize an intrinsic resource property called the term frequency (tf).
For each term, term frequency (tf) measures how many times the term appears
in a resource. It is intuitive that term frequency itself has an ability to summa­
rize a resource. If a term such as “automobile” appears frequently in a resource,
we can assume that one of the topics discussed in the resource is automobiles
and that a query for “automobile” should retrieve this resource. Another prob­
lem with the term frequency measure occurs when resource descriptions have
508

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

different lengths (a very common occurrence in organizing systems). In order to
compensate for different resource description lengths that would bias the term
frequency count and the calculated relevance towards longer documents, the
length of the term vectors are normalized as a percentage of the description
length rather than a raw count.
Relying solely on term frequency to determine the relevance of a resource for a
query has a drawback: if a term occurs in all resources in a collection it cannot
distinguish resources. For example, if every resource discusses automobiles, all
resources are potentially relevant for an “automobile” query. Hence, there
should be an additional mechanism that penalize a term appearing in too many
resources. This is done with inverse document frequency, which signals how of­
ten a term or property occurs in a collection.
Inverse document frequency (idf) is a collection-level property. The document
frequency (df) is the number of resources containing a particular term. The in­
verse document frequency (idf) for a term is defined as idft = log(N/dft), where
N is the total number of documents. The inverse document frequency of a term
decreases the more documents contain the term, providing a discriminating fac­
tor for the importance of terms in a query. For example, in a collection contain­
ing resources about automobiles, an information retrieval interaction can han­
dle a query for “automobile accident” by lowering the importance of “automo­
bile” and increasing the importance of “accident” in the resources that are se­
lected as result set.
As a first step of a search, resource descriptions are compared with the terms in
the query. In the vector space model, a metric for calculating similarities be­
tween resource description and query vectors combining the term frequency
and the inverse document frequency is used to rank resources according to
their relevance with respect to the query.612[Com]
The probability ranking principle is mathematically and theoretically better mo­
tivated than the vector space ranking principle. However, multiple methods
have been proposed to estimate the probability of relevance. Well-known proba­
bilistic retrieval methods are Okapi BM25, language models (LM) and diver­
gence from randomness models (DFR).613[Com] Although these models vary in
their estimations of the probability of relevance for a given resource and differ
in their mathematical complexity, intrinsic properties of resources like term fre­
quency and collection-level properties like inverse document frequency and oth­
ers are used for these calculations.

10.4.2.2 Synonym Expansion with Latent Semantic Indexing
Latent semantic indexing is a variation of the vector space model where a math­
ematical technique known as singular value decomposition is used to combine
similar term vectors into a smaller number of vectors that describe their “statis­
10.4 Implementing Interactions

509

The Discipline of Organizing

tical center.” 614[Com] This method is based mostly on collection-level properties
like co-occurrence of terms in a collection. Based on the terms that occur in all
resources in a collection, the method calculates which terms might be synonyms
of each other or otherwise related. Put another way, latent semantic indexing
groups terms into topics. Let us say the terms “roses” and “flowers” often occur
together in the resources of a particular collection. The latent semantic index­
ing methodology recognizes statistically that these terms are related, and repla­
ces the representations of the “roses” and “flower” terms with a computed “la­
tent semantic” term that captures the fact that they are related, reducing the di­
mensionality of resource description (see §5.3.4.4 Vocabulary Control as Dimen­
sionality Reduction (page 250)). Since queries are translated into the same set of
components, a query for “roses” will also retrieve resources that mention “flow­
er.” This increases the chance of a resource being found relevant to a query
even if the query terms do not match the resource description terms exactly;
the technique can therefore improve the quality of search.
Latent semantic indexing has been shown to be a practical technique for esti­
mating the substitutability or semantic equivalence of words in larger text seg­
ments, which makes it effective in information retrieval, text categorization, and
other NLP applications like question answering. In addition, some people view it
as a model of the computational processes and representations underlying sub­
stantial portions of how knowledge is acquired and used, because latent seman­
tic analysis techniques produces measures of word-word, word-passage, and
passage-passage relations that correlate well with human cognitive judgments
and phenomena involving association or semantic similarity. These situations in­
clude vocabulary tests, rate of vocabulary learning, essay tests, prose recall,
and analogical reasoning.615[CogSci]
Another approach for increasing the quality of search is to add similar terms or
properties to a query from a controlled vocabulary or classification system.
When a query can be mapped to terms in the controlled vocabulary or classes in
the classification, the inherent semantic structure of the vocabulary or classifi­
cation can suggest additional terms (broader, narrower, synonymous) whose oc­
currence in resources can signal their relevance for a query.

10.4.2.3 Structure-Based Retrieval
When the internal structure of a resource is represented in its resource descrip­
tion a search interaction can use the structure to retrieve more specific parts of
a resource. This enables parametric or zone searching, where a particular com­
ponent or resource property can be searched while all other properties are dis­
regarded.616[Com] For example, a search for “Shakespeare” in the title field in a
bibliographic organizing system will only retrieve books with Shakespeare in
the title, not as an author. Because all resources use the same structure, this
structure is a collection-level property.

A common structure-based retrieval technique is the search in relational data­
bases with Structured Query Language (SQL). With the help of tools to facilitate
selection and transformation, particular tables and fields in tables and in many
combination or with various constraints can be applied to yield highly precise
results.
A format like XML enables structured resource descriptions and is therefore
very suitable for search and for structured navigation and retrieval. XPath (see
§6.5.2) describes how individual parts of XML documents can be reached within
the internal structure. XML Query Language (XQuery), a structure-based re­
trieval language for XML, executes queries that can fulfill both topical and
structural constraints in XML documents. For example, a query can be ex­
pressed for documents containing the word “apple” in text, and where “apple”
is also mentioned in a title or subtitle, or in a glossary of terms.

10.4.2.4 Clustering / Classification
Clustering (§7.5.3.3) and computational classification (§8.7) are both interac­
tions that use individual and collection-level resource properties to execute
their operation. During clustering (unsupervised learning), all resources are
compared and grouped with respect to their similarity to each other. During
computational classification (supervised learning), an individual resource or a
group of resources is compared to a given classification or controlled vocabu­
lary in an organizing system and the resource is assigned to the most similar
class or descriptor. Another example for a classification interaction is spam de­
tection. (See §8.7.) Author identification or characterization algorithms attempt
to determine the author of a given work (a classification interaction) or to char­
acterize the type of author that has or should write a work (a clustering interac­
tion).

10.4.3 Interactions Based on Derived Properties
Interactions in this category derive or compute properties or features that are
not inherent to the resources themselves or the collection. External data sour­
ces, services, and tools are employed to support these interactions. Building in­
teractions with conditionality based on externally derived properties usually in­
creases the quality of the interactions by increasing the system’s context aware­
ness.

10.4.3.1 Popularity-Based Retrieval
Google’s PageRank (see §6.5.3) is the most well-known popularity measure for
websites.617[Web] The basic idea of PageRank is that a website is as popular as the
number of links referencing the website. The actual calculation of a website’s
PageRank involves more sophisticated mathematics than counting the number

of in-links, because the source of links
is also important. Links that come
from quality websites contribute more
to a website’s PageRank than other
links, and links to qualitatively low
websites will hurt a website’s Pag­
eRank.
An information retrieval model for
web pages can now use PageRank to
determine the value of a web page
with respect to a query. Google and
other web search engines use many
different ranking features to deter­
mine the final rank of a web page for
any search, PageRank as a popularity
measure is only one of them.

Retail analytics companies use cam­
eras and other sensors to analyze
shopper activity in retail stores and
generate heatmaps of which areas
see the most foot traffic and which
items customers interact with most.

Other popularity measures can be
used to rank resources. For example,
frequency of use, buying frequency
for retail goods, the number of laun­
dry cycles a particular piece of cloth­
ing has gone through, and even
whether it is due for a laundry cycle
right now.

10.4.3.2 Citation-Based Retrieval

Citation-based retrieval is a sophisti­
cated
and highly effective technique

ces are linked to each other by cita­
tions, that is, when one publication cites another. When a bibliographic resource
is referenced by another resource, those two resources are probably thematical­
ly related. The idea of citation-based search is to use a known resource as the
information need and retrieve other resources that are related by citation.
Citation-based search can be implemented by directly following citations from
the original resource or to find resources that cite the original resource. Anoth­
er comparison technique is the principle of bibliographic coupling, where the in­
formation retrieval system looks for other resources that cite the same resour­
ces as the original resource. Citation-based search results can also be ranked,

512

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

for example, by the number of in-citations a publication has received (the Pag­
eRank popularity measure actually derives from this principle).

10.4.3.3 Translation
During translation, resources are transformed into another language, with vary­
ing degrees of success. In contrast to the transformations that are performed in
order to merge resources from different organizing systems to prepare them for
further interactions, a translation transforms the resource after it has been re­
trieved or located. Dictionaries or parallel corpora are external resources that
drive a translation.
During a dictionary-based translation, every individual term (sometimes phra­
ses) in a resource description is looked up in a dictionary and replaced with the
most likely translation. This is a simple translation, as it cannot take grammati­
cal sentence structures or context into account. Context can have an important
impact on the most likely translation: the French word avocat should be transla­
ted into lawyer in most organizing systems, but probably not in a cookbook col­
lection, in which it is the avocado fruit.
Parallel corpora are a way to overcome many of these challenges. Parallel cor­
pora are the same or similar texts in different languages. The Bible or the proto­
cols of United Nations (UN) meetings are popular examples because they exist
in parallel in many different languages. A machine learning algorithm can learn
from these corpora to derive which phrases and other grammatical structures
can be translated in which contexts. This knowledge can then be applied to fur­
ther resource translation interactions.

10.4.4 Interactions Based on Combining Resources
Interactions in this category combine resources mostly from different organiz­
ing systems to provide services that a single organizing system could not ena­
ble. Sometimes different organizing systems with related resources are created
on purpose in order to protect the privacy of personal information or to protect
business interests. Releasing organizing systems to the public can have unwan­
ted consequences when clever developers detect the potential of connecting
previously unrelated data sources.

10.4.4.1 Mash-Ups
A mash-up combines data from several resources, which enables an interaction
to present new information that arises from the combination.618[Web] For exam­
ple, housing advertisements have been combined with crime statistics on maps
to graphically identify rentals that are available in relatively safe neighbor­
hoods.

crime, schools, housing prices, commute times, and other factors relevant
to people searching for a new place to live.
(Screenshots by Ian MacFarland.)

Mash-ups are usually ad-hoc combinations at the resource level and therefore
do not impact the “mashed-up” organizing systems’ internal structures or vo­
cabularies; they can be an efficient instrument for rapid prototyping on the web.
On the other hand, that makes them not very reliable or robust, because a
mash-up can fail in its operation as soon as the underlying organizing systems
change.

10.4.4.2 Linked Data Retrieval and Resource Discovery
In §9.4.3 The Semantic Web World (page 476), linked data relates resources
among different organizing system technologies via standardized and unique
identifiers (URIs). This simple approach connects resources from different sys­
tems with each other so that a cross-system search is possible.619[Web] For exam­
ple, two different online retailers selling a Martha Stewart bedspread can link
to a website describing the bedspread on the Martha Stewart website. Both re­
tailers use the same unique identifier for the bedspread, which leads back to the
Martha Stewart site.
Resource discovery or linked data retrieval are search interactions that traverse
the network (or semantic web graph) via connecting links in order to discover
semantically related resources. A search interaction could therefore use the link
from one retailer to the Martha Stewart website to discover the other retailer,
which might have a cheaper or more convenient offer.

10.5 Evaluating Interactions
Managing the quality of an interaction with respect to its intent or goal is a cru­
cial part of every step from design through implementation and especially dur­
ing operation. Evaluating the quality of interactions at different times in the de­
sign process (design concept, prototype, implementation, and operation) reveals
both strengths and weaknesses to the designers or operators of the organizing
system.
During the design and implementation stages, interactions need to be tested
against the original goals of the interaction and the constraints that are im­
posed by the organizing system, its resources and external conditions. It is very
common for processes in interactions to be tweaked or tuned to better comply
with the original goals and intentions for the interaction. Evaluation during
these stages often attempts to provide a calculable way to measure this compli­
ance and supports the fine-tuning process. It should be an integral part of an
iterative design process.
During the later implementation and operation stages, interactions are evalu­
ated with respect to the dynamically changing conditions of the organizing sys­
tem and its environment. User expectations as well as environmental conditions
or constraints can change and need to be checked periodically. A systematic
evaluation of interactions ensures that changes that affect an interaction are ob­
served early and can be integrated in order to adjust and even improve the in­
teraction. At these stages, more subjective evaluation aspects like satisfaction,
experience, reputation, or “feel” also play a role in fine-tuning the interactions.
This subjective part of the evaluation process is as important as the quantita­
tive, objective part. Many factors during the design and implementation pro­

10.5 Evaluating Interactions

515

The Discipline of Organizing

cesses need to be considered and made to work together. Ongoing quality evalu­
ation and feedback ensures that interactions work as intended.
Evaluation aspects can be distinguished in numerous ways: by the effort and
time to perform them (both data collection and analysis); by how quantifiable
they are or how comparable they are with measures in other organization sys­
tems; by what component of the interaction or organizing system they focus on;
or by the discipline, expertise, or methodologies that are used for the evalua­
tion.
A common and important distinction is the difference between efficiency, effec­
tiveness, and satisfaction. An interaction is efficient when it performs its actions
in a timely and economical manner, effective when it performs its actions cor­
rectly and completely, satisfactory when it performs as expected. Satisfaction is
the least quantifiable of the evaluation aspects because it is highly dependent
on individual tastes and experiences.
Let us assume that Shopstyle.com develops a new interaction that lets you com­
pare coat lengths from the offerings of their various retailers. Once the interac­
tion is designed, an evaluation takes place in order to determine whether all
coats and their lengths are integrated in the interaction and whether the coat
lengths are measured and compared correctly. The designers would not only
want to know whether the coat lengths are represented correctly but also
whether the interaction performs efficiently. When the interaction is ready to be
released (usually first in beta or test status), users and retailers will be asked
whether the interaction improves their shopping experience, whether the com­
parison performs as they expected, and what they would change. These evalua­
tion styles work hand in hand in order to improve the interaction.

10.5.1 Efficiency
When evaluating the efficiency of an organizing system, we focus on the time,
energy and economic resources needed in order to achieve the interaction goals
of the system. Commonly, the fewer resources are needed for achieving a suc­
cessful interaction, the more efficient the interaction.
Efficiency measures are usually related to engineering aspects such as the time
to perform an action, number of steps to perform an interaction, or amount of
computing resources used. Efficiency with respect to the human costs of memo­
ry load, attention, and cognitive processing is also important if there is to be a
seamless user experience where users can interact with the system in a timely
manner.
For a lot of organizing system interactions, however, effectiveness is the more
important aspect, particularly for those interactions that we have looked at so
far. If search results are not correct, then users will not be satisfied by even the

516

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

most usable interface. Many interactions are evaluated with respect to their
ability to return relevant resources. Why and how this is evaluated is the focus
of the remainder of this section.

10.5.2 Effectiveness
Effectiveness evaluates the correct output or results of an interaction. An effec­
tive interaction achieves relevant, intended or expected results. The concept of
relevance and its relationship to effectiveness is pivotal in information retrieval
and machine learning interactions. (§10.5.2.1) Effectiveness measures are often
developed in the fields that developed the algorithm for the interaction, infor­
mation retrieval, or machine learning. Precision and recall are the fundamental
measures of relevance or effectiveness in information retrieval or machine
learning interactions. (§10.5.2.2)

10.5.2.1 Relevance
Relevance is widely regarded as the fundamental concept of information retriev­
al, and by extension, all of information science. Despite being one of the more
intuitive concepts in human communication, relevance is notoriously difficult to
define and has been the subject of much debate over the past century.
Historically, relevance has been addressed in logic and philosophy since the no­
tion of inference was codified (to infer B from A, A must be relevant to B). Other
fields have attempted to deal with relevance as well: sociology, linguistics, and
psychology in particular. The subject knowledge view, subject literature view,
logical view, system’s view, destination’s view, pertinence view, pragmatic view
and the utility-theoretic interpretation are different perspectives on the ques­
tion of when something is relevant. In 1997, Mizzaro surveyed 160 research ar­
ticles on the topic of relevance and arrived at this definition: “relevance can be
seen as a point in a four-dimensional space, the values of each of the four di­
mensions being: (i) Surrogate, document, information; (ii) query, request, infor­
mation need, problem; (iii) topic, context, and each combination of them; and
(iv) the various time instants from the arising of problem until its solution.” This
rather abstract definition points to the terminological ambiguity surrounding
the concept.
For the purpose of organizing systems, relevance is a concept for evaluating ef­
fectiveness that describes whether a stated or implicit information need is satis­
fied in a particular user context and at a particular time. One of the challenges
for the evaluation of relevance in organizing systems is the gap between a us­
er’s information need (often not directly stated), and an expression of that infor­
mation need (a query). This gap might result in ambiguous results in the inter­
action. For example, suppose somebody speaks the word “Paris” (query) into a
smart phone application seeking advice on how to travel to Paris, France. The

10.5 Evaluating Interactions

517

The Discipline of Organizing

response includes offers for the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. Does the result satisfy
the information need? What if the searcher receives advice on Paris but has al­
ready seen every one of the resources the organizing system offers? What is the
correct decision on relevance here?
The key to calculating effectiveness is to be aware of what is being measured. If
the information need as expressed in the query is measured, the topical rele­
vance or topicality—a system-side perspective is analyzed. If the information
need as in a person’s mind is measured, the pertinence, utility, or situational
relevance—a subjective, personal perspective is analyzed. This juxtaposition is
the point of much research and contention in the field of information retrieval,
because topical relevance is objectively measurable, but subjective relevance is
the real goal. In order to evaluate relevance in any interaction, an essential pre­
requisite is deciding which of these notions of relevance to consider.

10.5.2.2 The Recall / Precision Tradeoff
Precision measures the accuracy of a result set, that is, how many of the re­
trieved resources for a query are relevant. Recall measures the completeness of
the result set, that is, how many of the relevant resources in a collection were
retrieved. Let us assume that a collection contains 20 relevant resources for a
query. A retrieval interaction retrieves 10 resources in a result set, 5 of the re­
trieved resources are relevant. The precision of this interaction is 50% (5 out of
10 retrieved resources are relevant); the recall is 25% (5 out of 20 relevant re­
sources were retrieved).622[Com]
It is in the nature of information retrieval interactions that recall and precision
trade off with each other. To find all relevant resources in a collection, the inter­
action has to cast a wide net and will not be very precise. In order to be very
precise and return only relevant resources to the searcher, an interaction has to
be very discriminating and will probably not find all relevant resources. When a
collection is very large and contains many relevant resources for any given
query, the priority is usually to increase precision. However, when a collection is
small or the information need also requires finding all relevant documents (e.g.,
in case law, patent searches, or medical diagnosis support), then the priority is
put on increasing recall.
The completeness and granularity of the organizing principles in an organizing
system have a large impact on the trade-off between recall and precision. (See
Chapter 4.) When resources are organized in fine-grained category systems and
many different resource properties are described, high-precision searches are
possible because a desired resource can be searched as precisely as the de­
scription or organization of the system allows. However, very specialized de­
scription and organization may preclude certain resources from being found;
consequently, recall might be sacrificed. If the organization is superficial—like

518

Chapter 10 — Interactions with Resources

Informatics Edition

your sock drawer, for example—you can find all the socks you want (high recall)
but you have to sort through a lot of socks to find the right pair (low precision).
The trade-off between recall and precision is closely associated with the extent
of the organization.

10.5.3 Satisfaction
Satisfaction evaluates the opinion, experience or attitude of a user towards an
interaction. Because satisfaction depends on individual user opinions, it is diffi­
cult to quantify. Satisfaction measures arise out of the user’s experience with
the interaction—they are mostly aspects of user interfaces, usability, or subjec­
tive and aesthetic impressions.
Usability measures whether the interaction and the user interface designed for
it correspond with the user's expectations of how they should function. It partic­
ularly focuses on the usefulness of the interaction. Usability analyzes ease-ofuse, learnability, and cognitive effort to measure how well users can use an in­
teraction to achieve their task.
Although efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction are measured differently and
affect different components of the interaction, they are equally important for the
success of an interaction. Even if an interaction is fast, it is not very useful if it
arrives at incorrect results. Even if an interaction works correctly, user satisfac­
tion is not guaranteed. One of the challenges in designing interactions is that
these factors invariably involve tradeoffs. A fast system cannot be as precise as
one that prioritizes the use of contextual information. An effective interaction
might require a lot of effort from the user, which does not make it very easy to
use, so the user satisfaction might decrease. The priorities of the organizing
system and its designers will determine which properties to optimize.
Let us continue our Shopstyle coat-length comparison interaction example.
When the coat length calculation is performed in an acceptable amount of time
and does not consume a lot of the organizing systems resources, the interaction
is efficient. When all coat lengths are correctly measured and compared, the in­
teraction is effective. When the interaction is seamlessly integrated into the
shopping process, visually supported in the interface, and not cognitively ex­
hausting, is it probably satisfactory for a user, as it provides a useful service (es­
pecially for someone with irregular body dimensions). What aspect should Shop­
style prioritize? It will probably weigh the consequences of effectiveness versus
efficiency and satisfaction. For a retail- and consumer-oriented organizing sys­
tem, satisfaction is probably one of the more important aspects, so it is highly
likely that efficiency and effectiveness might be sacrificed (in moderation) in fa­
vor of satisfaction.

10.6 Key Points in Chapter Ten
• Interactions arise naturally from the affordances of resources or are pur­
posefully designed into organizing systems.
(See §10.1 Introduction (page 487))
• Accessing and merging resources are fundamental interactions that occur in
almost every organizing system.
(See §10.1 Introduction (page 487))
• User requirements, which layer of resource properties is used, and the legal,
social and organizational environment can distinguish interactions.
(See §10.2 Determining Interactions (page 492))
• Limited memory and attention capacities prevent people from remembering
everything and make them unable to consider more than a few things or
choices at once.
(See §10.2.1 User Requirements (page 492))
• The principles of behavioral economics can be used to design organizing sys­
tems that manipulate people into taking actions and making choices that
they might not intend or that are not in their best interests.
(See the sidebar, Behavioral Economics (page 495))
• In order to enable interactions, it is necessary to identify, describe, and
sometimes transform the resources in an organizing system.
(See §10.3.1 Identifying and Describing Resources for Interactions (page
499))
• Similar to mapping, a straightforward approach to transformation is the use
of crosswalks, which are equivalence tables that relate resource description
elements, semantics, and writing systems from one organizing system to
those of another.
(See §10.3.2.2 Modes of Transformation (page 503))
• Merging transformations can be distinguished by type (mapping or cross­
walk), time (design time or run time) and mode (manual or automatic).
(See §10.3.2.3 Granularity and Abstraction (page 503))
• Implementations can be distinguished by the source of the algorithm (infor­
mation retrieval, machine learning, natural language processing), by their
complexity (number of actions needed), by whether resources are changed,
or by the resource description layers they are based on.
(See §10.4 Implementing Interactions (page 505))

• Important aspects for the evaluation of interactions are efficiency (timeli­
ness and cost-effectiveness), effectiveness (accuracy and relevance) and sat­
isfaction (positive attitude of the user).
(See §10.5 Evaluating Interactions (page 515))
• The concept of relevance and its relationship to effectiveness is pivotal in in­
formation retrieval and machine learning interactions.
(See §10.5.2.1 Relevance (page 517))
• The trade-off between recall and precision decides whether a search finds all
relevant documents (high recall) or only relevant documents (high preci­
sion).
(See §10.5.2.2 The Recall / Precision Tradeoff (page 518))
• The extent of the organization principles also impacts recall and precision:
more fine-grained organization allows for more precise interactions.

In order to more easily use and reuse content, as well as have the ability
to integrate different learning tools into a single Learning Management System
(LMS), Global Learning Consortium, an organization composed of 140 members
from leading educational institutions and education-related companies, has re­
leased specifications to make this possible. Called Common Cartridge and
Learning Tools Interoperability (http://www.imsglobal.org/commoncartridge.html),
the specifications provide a common format and guidelines to construct tools
and create content that can be easily imported into learning management sys­
tems. Common Cartridge (CC) specifications give detailed descriptions of the di­
rectory structure, metadata and information models associated with a particular
learning object. For example, a learning package from a provider from McGrawHill may contain content from a book, some interactive quizzes, and some multi­
media to support the text. CC specifies how files would be organized within a di­
rectory, how links would be represented, how the package would communicate
with a backend server, how to describe each of the components, and the like.
This would enable a professor or a student using any capable learning manage­
ment system to import a “cartridge” or learning material and have it appear in a
consistent manner with all other learning materials within the LMS. This means

that content providers need not maintain multiple versions of the same content
just to conform to the formats of different systems, allowing them to focus their
resources on creating more content as opposed to maintaining the ones they al­
ready have. Looking at this in the context of the interoperability framework, we
see that while information from providers are in a structured digital form, the
main problem was that users were consuming the content using competing sys­
tems that had their own data formats by which to accept content. Huge publish­
ers, wanting to increase distribution of their product, offered their content in all
these different formats. While the specifications that the LMS created refer to
the technical considerations in creating content and tools, the process of getting
to that point involved a lot of organizational and political discussions. Internally,
content and LMS providers needed to set aside the necessary resources to re­
factor their products to conform to the standards. Externally, competing provid­
ers had to collaborate with one another to create the specifications.
A conceptual framework for analyzing users and their work tasks for de­
sign requirements is (Fidel 2012). A general survey of design methods is given
in (Hanington and Martin 2012). Designing particularly for successful interac­
tions (services) is discussed in (Polaine, Løvlie and Reason). (Resmini and Rosati
2011) describe designing for engaged users using cross-channel, cross-media
information architecture.

A good example for the importance of standards and interoperability
rules is E-government. E-government refers to the ability to deliver government
services through electronic means. These services can range from governmentto-citizen, government-to-business, government-to-employees, government-togovernment, and vice-versa (Guijarro 2007), (Scholl 2007). This could range
from a government unit providing a portal where citizens can apply for a driv­
er’s license or file their taxes, to more complex implementations such as allow­
ing different government agencies to share certain pertinent information with
one another, such as providing information on driver’s license holders to the po­
lice. Because the government interacts with heterogeneous entities and their
various systems, e-government planners must consider how to integrate and in­
teroperate with different systems and data models. Countries belonging to the

Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have continu­
ously refined their strategies for e-government.
An example of a highly successful implementation of a business-to-government
implementation is the use of the Universal Business Language (UBL) by the
Government of Denmark. UBL is a “royalty-free library of standard electronic
XML business documents such as purchase orders and invoices” [oasisopen.org]. The Government of Denmark localized these standards, and manda­
ted all organizations wanting to do business with the government to use these
formats for invoicing. By automating the matching process between an electron­
ic order and an electronic invoice, the government expects total potential sav­
ings of about 160 million Euros per year [UBL case study], thus highlighting the
need for a standard format by which businesses can send in orders and invoices
electronically.
Recognizing that its position as government entails that all types of suppliers,
big or small, must have equal opportunity to sell its products and services, the
Government of Denmark not only set data format standards, it also gave several
options by which information can be exchanged. Paper-based invoices would be
sent to scanning agencies that would scan and create electronic versions to be
submitted to the government. This highlights the different organizational and
consumption issues that the government of Denmark had to consider when de­
signing the system.
While data encoding describes how information is represented, and data
exchange formats describe how information is structured, communication proto­
cols refer to how information is exchanged between systems. These protocols
dictate how these documents are enclosed within messages, and how these
messages are transmitted across the network. Things such as message format,
error detection and reporting, security and encryption are described and con­
sidered. Nowadays, there are a number of communication protocols that are
used over networks, including File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) commonly used in the Internet, Post Office Protocol (POP) com­
monly used for e-mail, and other protocols under the Transmission Control Pro­
tocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite. Different product manufacturers normally
also have more proprietary protocols that they employ, including Apple Comput­
er Protocols Suite and Cisco Protocols. In addition, different types of networks
would also have corresponding protocols, including Mobile Wireless Protocols
and such.

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), is used to exchange formatted mes­
sages between computers or systems. Organizations use this format to conduct
business transactions electronically without human intervention, such as in
sending and receiving purchase orders or exchange invoice information and
such. There are four main standards that have been developed for EDI, includ­

ing the UN/EDIFACT standard recommended by the United Nations (UN), ANSI
ASC X12 standard widely used in the US, TRADACOMS standard that is widely
used in the UK, and the ODETTE standard used in the European automotive in­
dustry. These standards include formats for a wide range of business activities,
such as shipping notices, fund transfers, and the like. EDI messages are highly
formatted, with the meaning of the information being transmitted being highly
dependent on its position in the document. For instance, a line in an EDI docu­
ment with BEG*00*NE*MOG009364501**950910*CSW11096^ corresponds to a line in the
X12 standard for Purchase Orders (standard 850). “BEG” specifies the start of a
Purchase Order Transaction Set. The asterisk (*) symbol delineates between
items in the line, with each value corresponding to a particular field or informa­
tion component described in the standard. “NE,” for example, corresponds to
the Purchase Order Type Code, which in this instance is “New Order.” As can be
seen in the example, the description of the information being transmitted is not

Allowing unrestricted access to data and business processes also be­
comes a problem when working across organizations. Fully integrating systems
between two companies, for instance, may entail the exposure of business intel­
ligence and information that should be kept private. This type of exposure is too
much for most businesses, regardless of whether the relationship with the other
business is collaborative rather than competitive. There are security issues to
be considered, as collaborating organizations would need to access private net­
works and secure servers. The heterogeneity in supporting organizing systems
along with the need to quickly evolve with the rapid changes in an organiza­
tion’s competitive and collaborative environment has pushed organizations to
shift from more vertical, isolated structures to a more loosely coupled, ecosys­
tem paradigm This has led to more componentized and modularized systems
that need only to exchange information or transform resources when an interac­
tion requires it.
[590][Bus]

The emerging paradigm then is to enable independent systems to interoperate,
or to have “the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange infor­

524

mation and to use the information that has been exchanged.” Because the focus
is in the exchange of resources or resource descriptions, independent systems
need not necessarily know other systems’ underlying logic or implementation,
for example, how they store resources. What is important is knowing what kind
of resource is expected and in what format (notation, writing system, seman­
tics), and what kind of information is returned for a particular. This is a strate­
gic approach to exchanging resources, as systems can remain highly independ­
ent of each other. Changes in one system need not necessarily affect how other
systems work as long as the information that is sent and received through an in­
terface stays the same. This allows greater adaptability, as changes to system
logic or business processes can be done in self-contained modules without nec­
essarily affecting others. The transformation then happens in an intermediate
space where the agreements on resource descriptions are fixed.

More commonly, graphical data mapping tools are included in an ex­
tract, transform, and load (ETL) database suite that provides additional power­
ful data transformation capabilities. Whereas data mapping is the first step in
capturing the relationships between different systems, data transformation en­
tails code generation that uses the resulting maps to produce an executable
transformational program that converts the source data into target format. ETL
databases extract the information needed from the outside sources, transform
these into information that can be used by the target system using the necessa­
ry data mappings, and then loads it into the end system.
[600][Com]

Languages such as XSLT and Turing eXtender Language (TXL) facilitate
the ease of data transformation while various commercial data warehousing
tools provide varying functionalities such as single/multiple source acquisition,
data cleansing, and statistical and analytical capabilities. Based on XML, XSLT
is a declarative language designed for transforming XML documents into other
documents. For example, XSLT can be used to convert XML data into HTML
documents for web display or PDF for print or screen display. XSLT processing
entails taking an input document in XML format and one or more XSLT style
sheets through a template-processing engine to produce a new document.

Each of the four information retrieval models discussed in the chapter
has different combinations of the comparing, ranking, and location activities.
Boolean and vector space models compare the description of the information
need with the description of the information resource. Vector space and proba­
bilistic models rank the information resource in the order that the resource can
satisfy the user’s query. Structure-based search locates information using inter­
nal or external structure of the information resource.
[606][Com]

Our discussion of information retrieval models in this chapter does not
attempt to address information retrieval at the level of theoretical and technical
detail that informs work and research in this field (Manning et al. 2008), (Croft
et al. 2009). Instead, our goal is to introduce IR from a more conceptual per­
spective, highlighting its core topics and problems using the vocabulary and
principles of IO as much as possible.

11.1 Introduction
Chapter 1 defined an organizing system as “an intentionally arranged collection
of resources and the interactions they support.” An organizing system emerges
as the result of decisions about what is organized, why it is organized, how
much it is organized, when it is organized, and how or by whom it is organ­
ized. These decisions and the tradeoffs they embody are manifested in the four
common activities of organizing systems—selecting resources, organizing them,
designing and supporting interactions with them, and maintaining them—which
we described in Chapter 2. Chapters 4-10 progressively explained each of the
parts of the organizing system: resources, resource descriptions, resource cate­
gories and collections, and interactions with resources—introducing additional
concepts and methods associated with each of these parts.
Along the way we described many types of organizing systems. Sometimes we
discussed broad categories of organizing systems, like those for libraries, muse­
ums, business information systems, and compositions of web-based services. At
other times we described specific instances of organizing systems, like those in
the Seed Library, the Flickr photo sharing site, Amazon’s drop shipment store,
and your home kitchen or closet.
We can now build on the foundation created by Chapters 1-10 to create a “road­
map” that organizes and summarizes the design issues and choices that emerge

The Discipline of Organizing

during an organizing system’s lifecycle. These design choices follow patterns
that help us understand existing organizing systems better, while also suggest­
ing how to invent new ones by making a different set of design choices.
The roadmap is extensively annotated with references to the preceding chapters
where the issues and choices mentioned in the roadmap were introduced and
discussed in detail. We will use this roadmap to analyze a variety of case study
examples in Chapter 12, and to explore the “design neighborhood” around each
of them. The design questions from Chapter 1 serve as a template to give each
case study the same structure, which we hope enables instructors, students,
and others who read this book to add to this collection of case studies by contri­
buting their own at DisciplineOfOrganizing.org.

Navigating This Chapter
We begin with a look at §11.2 The Organizing System Lifecycle (page
529) which proposes four phases, each of which is discussed in its
own section. The first phase, which largely determines the extent
and complexity of the resource descriptions needed for organizing
and interactions, is §11.3 Defining and Scoping the Organizing Sys­
tem Domain (page 530). The second phase, which is highly shaped by
economic factors and technology constraints or choices, is
§11.4 Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System (page 536).
§11.5 Designing and Implementing an Organizing System (page 542),
emphasizes the need for clearly separating requirements from imple­
mentation, a principle we call architectural thinking. The final phase
is discussed in §11.6 Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System
(page 546), where we distinguish the maintenance of specific resour­
ces and descriptions from the maintenance of the system as a whole.

11.2 The Organizing System Lifecycle
System lifecycle models exhibit great variety; for our purposes it suffices to use
a generic four-phase model that distinguishes a domain definition and scoping
phase, a requirements phase, a design and implementation phase, and an opera­
tional and maintenance phase. These phases are brief and mostly inseparable
for some simple organizing systems, more sequential for others, and more sys­
tematic and iterative for complex organizing systems.
Most of the specific decisions that must be made for an organizing system are
strongly shaped by the initial decisions about its domain, scope (the breadth or
variety of the resources), and scale (the number of resource instances). In or­
ganizing systems with limited scope and scale, most of these decisions are made
in an informal, unanalyzed, and holistic manner. For example, when we arrange
our bookshelves or closets it is not necessary to think explicitly about scoping,
requirements, design, implementation, and operational phases. For complex or­
ganizing systems, however, especially those in information-intensive domains, it
is important to follow a more systematic methodology.
Initial decisions about scope and requirements can create lasting technology
and process legacies that impact operational efficiency and flexibility. They can
also have profound and unforeseen ramifications for the users of the system and
other people affected by the work the system enables. A rigorous, welldocumented planning process can help organizers minimize unfair and ineffec­
tive outcomes, justify their difficult tradeoffs and decisions, and figure out what
went wrong so they can learn from their mistakes.
The consequences of releasing technical systems and tools into the world al­
ways include social, business, political, and legal dimensions in addition to tech­
nical ones. Some of these implications are due to the context in which the sys­
tem will operate (§10.4 Implementing Interactions (page 505)). Others are due to
the fact that the work of organizing system designers, architects, and develop­
ers is shaped by their experiences, values, beliefs, and circumstances—the often
hidden constraints and influences of their social position, education, cultural
context, and mental models of the world. Inevitably, the work of information
professionals involves “carving up the world at its joints,” creating classifica­
tions, models, and architectures that support interactions with resources. In
practice this often translates to creating artificial “joints” where none truly ex­
ist, which will always favor some and injure others. No modeling is ever com­
pletely faithful to reality for all people with all experiences (nor is it intended to
be), so those people not considered target users for a system, or who have
unique circumstances, may end up feeling slighted or ignored and may actually
suffer as a result.

11.2 The Organizing System Lifecycle

529

The Discipline of Organizing

11.3 Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain
The most fundamental decision for an organizing system is defining its domain,
the set or type of resources that are being organized. This is why “What is Being
Organized?” (§2.2) was the first of the design decisions we introduced in Chap­
ter 1.
We refine how we think about an organizing system domain by breaking it down
into five interrelated aspects:
1. the scope and scale of the collection
2. the number and nature of users
3. the time span or lifetime over which the organizing system will operate
4. the physical or technological environment in which the organizing system is
situated
5. the relationship of the organizing system to other ones that overlap with it in
domain or scope
Addressing these issues is a prerequisite for prioritizing requirements for the
organizing system, proposing the principles of its design, and implementing the
organizing system.

11.3.1 Scope and Scale of the Collection
The scope of a collection is the dominant factor in the design of an organizing
system, because it largely determines the extent and complexity of the resource
descriptions needed by organizing principles and interactions (§5.3.1.3). The im­
pact of broad scope arises more from the heterogeneity of the resources in a
collection than its absolute scale. It takes more effort to manage a broad and
large collection than a narrow and small one; it takes less effort to manage a
large collection if it has a narrow scope. A cattle ranch can get by with just one
worker for every thousand cows, unlike zoos, which typically have a small num­
ber of instances of many types of animals. A zoo needs many more workers be­
cause each animal type and sometimes even individual animals can have dis­
tinct requirements for their arrangement and care.
Consider a business information system being designed to contain millions of
highly structured and similar instances of a small number of related resource
types, such as purchase orders and their corresponding invoices.623[Com] The
analysis to determine the appropriate properties and principles for resource de­
scription and organization is straightforward, and any order or invoice is an
equally good instance to study.624[Com]

530

Chapter 11 — The Organizing System Roadmap

Informatics Edition

Contrast this large but very narrow collection with a small but very broad one
that contains a thousand highly variable instances of dozens of different re­
source types. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to determine if an instance is
representative of its resource type, and every resource might need to be ana­
lyzed. This variability implies a large and diverse set of resource descriptions
where individual resource instances might not be described with much preci­
sion because it costs too much to do it manually (§5.3.6.1). We can extrapolate
to understand why organizing systems whose resource collections are both
broad and deep, like those of Amazon or eBay, have come to rely on machine
learning techniques to identify description properties and construct resource
taxonomies (§5.3.6.4, §7.5.3.3).625[Com]
A partial remedy or compromise when the resource instances are highly dissimi­
lar is to define resource types more broadly or abstractly, reducing the overall
number of types. We illustrated this approach in §8.2.2.1 when we contrasted
how kitchen goods might be categorized broadly in a department store but
much more precisely in a wholesale kitchen supply store. The broader catego­
ries in the department store blur many of the differences between instances, but
in doing so yield a small set of common properties that can be used to describe
them. Because these common properties will be at a higher level of abstraction,
using them to describe resources will require less expertise and probably less
effort (§5.3.1.3, §7.4.1). However, this comes at a cost: Poets, painters, compos­
ers, sculptors, technical writers, and programmers all create resources, but de­
scribing all of them with a “creator” property, as the Dublin Core requires, loses
a great deal of precision.
Challenges caused by the scale of a collection are often related to constraints
imposed by the physical or technological environment in which the collection
exists that limit how large the collection can be or how it can be organized. (See
§3.3.1) Only a few dozen books can fit on a small bookshelf but thousands of
books can fit in your two-car garage, which is a typical size because most people
and families do not have more than two cars. On the other hand, if you are a
Hollywood mogul, superstar athlete, or sultan with a collection of hundreds of
cars, a two-car garage is orders of magnitudes too small to store your collec­
tion.626[Bus] Even collections of digital things can be limited in size by their tech­
nological environment, which you might have discovered when you ran out of
space for your songs and photos on your portable media player.
Estimating the ultimate size of a collection at the beginning of an organizing
system’s lifecycle can reduce scaling issues related to storage space for the re­
sources or for their descriptions. Other problems of scale are more fundamen­
tal. Larger collections need more people to organize and maintain them, creat­
ing communication and coordination problems that grow much faster than the
collection, especially when the collection is distributed in different locations.

11.3 Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain

531

The Discipline of Organizing

The best way to prevent problems of scope and scale is through standardization.
Standardization of resources can take place if they are created by automated
means so that every instance conforms to a schema or model (§7.5.2).627[Com]
Standards for describing bibliographic resources enable libraries to centralize
and share much resource description, and using the same standards for resour­
ces of diverse types helps address the challenge of broad scope by reducing the
need for close monitoring and coordination. Analogous standards for describing
information resources, services, or economic activities business, governmental,
or scientific information systems to systematically manage hundreds of millions
or even billions of transactional records or pieces of data (§5.3.1.3).

11.3.2 Number and Nature of Users
An organizing system might have only one user, as when an individual creates
and operates an organizing system for a clothes closet, a home bookcase or file
cabinet, or for digital files and applications on a personal computer or smart
phone. Collections of personal resources are often organized for highly individu­
alized interactions using ad hoc categories that are hard to understand for any
other user (§7.2.2). Personal collections or collections used by only a small num­
ber of people typically contain resources that they themselves selected, which
makes the most typical interaction with the organizing system searching for a
familiar known resource (§10.2.1).
At the other extreme, an organizing system can have national or even global
scope and have millions or more users like the Library of Congress classification
system, the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code, or the Inter­
net Domain Name System. These organizing systems employ systems of institu­
tional categories (§7.2.3) that are designed to support systematically specified
and purposeful interactions, often to search for previously unknown resources.
In between these extremes are the many kinds of organizing systems created by
informal and formal groups, by firms of every size, and by sets of cooperating
enterprises like those that carry out supply chains and other informationintensive business processes.
The nature and number of users strongly shapes the contents of an organizing
system and the interactions it must be designed to support. (See §10.2.1) Some
generic categories of users that apply in many domains are customers, clients,
visitors, operators, and managers. We can adapt the generic interactions sup­
ported by most organizing systems (§5.3.2) to satisfy these generic user types.
For example, while most organizing systems allow any type of user to browse or
search the collection to discover its content, only operators or managers are
likely to have access to information about the browsing and searching activities
of customers, clients, or visitors.

532

Chapter 11 — The Organizing System Roadmap

Informatics Edition

Once we have identified the organizing system’s domain more precisely we can
refine these generic user categories, classifying users and interactions with
more precision. For example, the customers of university libraries are mostly
professors and students, while the customers of online stores are mostly shop­
pers seeking to find something to purchase. Library customers borrow and re­
turn resources, often according to different policies for professors and students,
whereas online stores might only allow resources to be returned for refunds or
exchanges under limited circumstances.
Just as it is with collection scope, the heterogeneity of the user base is more
critical than its absolute size. An airport bookstore typically has a narrowly fo­
cused collection and treats its customers as generic travelers browsing impre­
cisely for something to fill their time in the terminal or on the airplane. In con­
trast, the local public library will have a much broader collection because it has
to meet the needs of a more diverse user base than the airport bookstore, and it
will support a range of interactions and services targeted to children learning to
read, school students, local businesses, retirees, and other categories of users.
A company library will focus its collection on its industry segment, making it
narrower in coverage than a local or university research library, but it might
provide specialized services for marketing, engineering, research, legal, or oth­
er departments of the firm.
Each category of users, and indeed each individual user, brings different experi­
ences, goals, and biases into interactions with the organizing system. As a re­
sult, organizing systems in the same domain and with nominally the same scope
can differ substantially in the resources they contain and the interactions they
support for different categories of users. The library for the Centers for Disease
Control and the WebMD website both contain information about diseases and
symptoms, but the former is primarily organized to support research in public
health and the latter is organized for consumers trying to figure out why they
are sick and how to get well. These contrasting purposes and targeted users are
manifested in different classification systems and descriptive vocabularies.
The designers of these systems do not necessarily share the same biases as
their users, and more importantly, they may not always understand them com­
pletely or correctly. This is precisely why good design is iterative: successive cy­
cles of evaluation and revision can shape crude, provisional, and misguided
ideas into wildly successful ones. But such nimbleness is not always feasible in
highly complex, political, or bureaucratic institutional contexts. Even then, as
Bowker and Star conclude, transparency is the best corrective for these sorts of
design failures. Designers who recognize that their systems have real conse­
quences for real people should commit to an ongoing process of negotiation that
enables those affected by the technology to voice and push back against any
detrimental effect it might have on them and their communities. This helps set
the stage for effective operation and maintenance of the system (§11.6.2).
11.3 Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain

533

The Discipline of Organizing

11.3.3 Expected Lifetime
The scope and scale of a collection and the size of its user population are often
correlated with the expected lifetime of its organizing system. Because small
personal organizing systems are often created in response to a specific situation
or to accomplish a specific task, they generally have short lifetimes (§7.2.2).
The expected lifetime of the organizing system is not the same as the expected
lifetime of the resources it contains because motivations for maintaining resour­
ces differ a great deal. (See §3.5.1) As we have just noted, some organizing sys­
tems created by individuals are tied to specific short-term tasks, and when the
task is completed or changes, the organizing system is no longer needed or
must be superseded by a new one. At the other extreme are libraries, museums,
archives, and other memory institutions designed to last indefinitely because
they exist to preserve valuable and often irreplaceable resources.
However, most business organizing systems contain relatively short-lived re­
sources that arise from and support day-to-day operations, in which case the or­
ganizing system has a long expected lifetime with impermanent resources. Fi­
nally, just to complete our 2 x 2 matrix, the auction catalog that organizes valua­
ble paintings or other collectibles is a short-lived single-purpose organizing sys­
tem whose contents are descriptions of resources with long expected lifetimes.

11.3.4 Physical or Technological Environment
An organizing system is often tied to a particular physical or technological envi­
ronment. A kitchen, closet, card cabinet, airplane cockpit, handheld computer
or smartphone, and any other physical environment in which resources are or­
ganized provides affordances to be taken advantage of and constraints that
must be accommodated by an organizing system (§3.4.1).629[Bus]
The extent of these physical and technological constraints affects the lifetime of
an organizing system because they make it more difficult to adapt to changes in
the set of resources being organized or the reasons for their organization. A
desk or cabinet with fixed “pigeon holes” or drawers affords less flexible organi­
zation than a file cabinet or open shelves. A building with hard-walled offices
constrains how people interact and collaborate more than an open floor plan
with modular cubicles does. Business processes implemented in a monolithic
enterprise software application are tightly coupled; those implemented as a
choreography of loosely-coupled web services can often transparently substitute
one service provider for another.

534

Chapter 11 — The Organizing System Roadmap

Informatics Edition

11.3.5 Relationship to Other Organizing Systems
The same domain or set of resources can have more than one organizing sys­
tem, and one organizing system can contain multiple others. The organizing sys­
tem for books in a library arranges books about cooking according to the Li­
brary of Congress or Dewey Decimal classifications and bookstores use the BI­
SAC ones, mostly using cuisine as the primary factor (§8.3). In turn, cookbooks
employ an organizing system for their recipes that arranges them by type of
dish, main ingredient, or method of preparation. Within a cookbook, recipes
might follow an organizing system that standardizes the order of their compo­
nent parts like the description, ingredients, and preparation steps.
Sometimes these multiple organizing systems can be designed in coordination
so they can function as a single hierarchical, or nested, organizing system in
which it is possible to emphasize different levels depending on the user’s task or
application. Most books and many documents have an internal structure with
chapters and hierarchical headings that enable readers to understand smaller
units of content in the context of larger ones (§6.5.2). Similarly, a collection of
songs can be treated as an album and organized using that level of abstraction
for the item, but each of those songs can also be treated as the unit of organiza­
tion, especially when they are embodied in separate digital files.
Organizing systems overlap and intersect. People and enterprises routinely in­
teract with many different organizing systems because what they do requires
them to use resources in ways that cut across context, device, or application
boundaries. Just consider how many different organizing systems we use as in­
dividuals for managing personal information like contacts, appointments, and
messages. As company employees we create and organize information in email,
document repositories, spreadsheets, and CRM and ERP systems. Now consider
this at an institutional scale in the inter-enterprise interactions among the or­
ganizing systems of physicians, hospitals, medical labs, insurance companies,
government agencies, and other parties involved in healthcare. Consider how
many of these are “mash-ups” and composite services that combine information
and resources from independently designed systems.
We have come to expect that the boundaries between organizing systems are of­
ten arbitrary and that we should be able to merge or combine them when that
would create additional value. It is surely impossible to anticipate all of these ad
hoc or dynamic intersections of organizing systems, but it is surely necessary to
recognize their inevitability, especially when the organizing systems contain dig­
ital information and are implemented using web architectures.

11.3 Defining and Scoping the Organizing System Domain

535

The Discipline of Organizing

11.4 Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System
The two parts of the definition of an organizing system explicitly suggest two
categories of requirements, those that specify the intentional arrangement of
the resources and those that specify the interactions with the resources. These
categories of requirements both depend on resource descriptions, which are im­
plied by but not explicitly called out in the definition of an organizing system.
Because description, arrangement, and interaction are interrelated it is impossi­
ble to describe them separately without some redundancy. Nevertheless, in this
book we have done that on purpose because taking different perspectives on or­
ganizing systems in Chapters 2-10 has enabled us to introduce a broad range of
concepts, issues, and methods:
• Every organizing system must enable users to interact with its collection of
resources (Chapters 3 and 10);
• The possible interactions depend primarily on the nature and extent of the
descriptions associated with the resources (Chapters 4, 5 and 6);
• Intentional arrangement emerges when one or more resource descriptions
are used by organizing principles (Chapters 7 and 8);
• Different implementations of the same organizing principle can determine
the efficiency or effectiveness of the interactions it enables. (Chapter 10).
If you are creating a personal organizing system or otherwise small-scale one
with only a small number of users, you might think there is little reason to think
explicitly about requirements. However, any project benefits from the discipline
of being more systematic about its purposes and their priorities. In addition, be­
ing explicit about requirements enables traceability and impact analysis. Trace­
ability means being able to relate an interaction or feature of a system to the re­
quirement it satisfies; impact analysis runs the causal link between require­
ments and features in the opposite direction to assess what or who will be affec­
ted if requirements change.630[Bus]

11.4.1 Requirements for Interactions
When we describe interactions in a generic or broad way as we did in Chap­
ter 3, Activities in Organizing Systems we see that all organizing systems have
some common interactions, but most of the time we want to pay attention to the
more specific interactions that are designed to create value in a particular or­
ganizing system because of the kind of resources it contains (§3.4.2). The do­
main, scope, and scale of the organizing system determines which interactions
are possible and which ones must be explicitly supported, but the priorities of

536

Chapter 11 — The Organizing System Roadmap

Informatics Edition

different interactions are more often determined by decisions about intended
users. (See §11.3.2.)
For most organizing systems other than personal ones, the set of interactions
that are implemented in an organizing system is strongly determined by busi­
ness model considerations, funding levels, or other economic factors. For-profit
firms often differentiate themselves by the number and quality of the interac­
tions they support with their resources, some by supporting many of them and
some by supporting a minimal number. This differentiation is strongly shaped by
and also shapes user preferences; some people prefer self-service or unmedi­
ated interactions, while others prefer full service and mediated interac­
tions.631[Bus] Non-profit institutions like public libraries and museums are also
subject to these constraints, but unfortunately they have fewer options for ad­
justing service levels or changing their targeted user populations when their
funding is reduced.
Some requirements for interactions come along with technology requirements,
to have resources in a particular format, to conform to a particular specification
or standard in order to operate in some technology environment, or to intero­
perate with other parties or their organizing systems.
An essential requirement in every organizing system is ensuring that the sup­
ported interactions can be discovered and invoked by their intended users. In
organizing systems with physical resources, good designers enhance the inher­
ent affordances of resources with navigation and orientation aids that direct
users to points of interactions (§3.4.1). With digital resources and informationintensive organizing systems, interactions are not immediately perceivable, and
poor design can create overly complicated user interfaces in which many inter­
actions are never discovered and thus never used.
It is tricky to compare the overall capabilities of organizing systems in terms of
the number or variety of their interactions because what matters more is how
much value they create. Organizing systems with active resources can create
value on their own without an explicit user interaction (§4.2.3.2). Other organiz­
ing systems exploit stored, computed, or contextual information to create value
by eliminating the need for user interactions, such as location-based smart­
phone apps that push information to you when you are near some particular lo­
cation or some person you know (§3.4.1).633[Bus]

11.4.2 About the Nature and Extent of Resource Description
Interactions with resources within an organizing system often depend on de­
scriptions of individual resources or descriptions of the collections that contain
them. In the bibliographic domain, generic or common interactions make use of
descriptions that can be associated with almost any type of resource, such as
the name, creator, and creation date.
11.4 Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System

537

The Discipline of Organizing

For example, any resource with a sortable name or identifier can be arranged
alphabetically to enable it to be easily found, and any resource with a creation
date can be discovered by a “what’s new” query to a resource collection.
Different types of resources must have differentiating properties, otherwise
there would be no reason to distinguish them as different types. These resource
properties can be recorded in the terms of a description language to support
one or more interactions or to answer one or more questions. Simply put,
choices about the nature and extent of resource description depend on which in­
teractions or questions are most frequent or important (§5.3.1.1). If a particular
property of a resource has no interactions that depend on it, there is no need to
describe it. However, if an interaction depends on a description of a particular
resource property, a missing description or one of inadequate precision and
granularity means that the interaction will be impossible or inefficient to carry
out because the resource will need to be further analyzed to create or extract
the required description. An ISBN is a sufficient description to find a book in a
directory, but if the ISBN is the only description associated with the book you
will not be able to tell who wrote it. The tradeoffs imposed by the extent and
timing of resource description have been a recurring theme in this book, with
the tradeoff between recall and precision being the most salient (§2.5, §3.4.1,
§7.4.1, §7.4.3).
The properties of resources that are easiest to describe are not always the most
useful ones, especially for information resources. Anyone can determine the
number of pages in a book, but often only a skilled cataloger can accurately de­
scribe what the book is about, a far more important property. (§5.2.2 “Descrip­
tion” as an Inclusive Term (page 220) and §7.3.4 The Limits of Property-Based
Categorization (page 346)) For non-text information resources this problem is
magnified because the content is often in a semantically opaque format that it
optimized for the devices that creates and processes it but which cannot useful­
ly be analyzed by people. (§4.4.2.5 The Semantic Gap (page 193) and §5.4 De­
scribing Non-text Resources (page 257))
Business strategy and economics strongly influence the extent of resource de­
scription. In many museums and archives there are not enough trained people
and time to describe every pottery fragment or document, and many resources
are described only at an aggregate level. In contrast, some people argue that
the explosion of content in physical and digital form mandates significant invest­
ment in descriptions that facilitate resource discovery in a crowded market­
place.
Automated and computerized processes can create the resource descriptions in
an organizing system and their use is primarily driven by scale (§5.3.6.4).
Search engines index web pages and analyze their link structures because it
would be impossible to treat the web as a traditional library and organize it by

human effort. The benefits of digital cameras, video recorders, and similar devi­
ces would be far fewer if people had to manually identify and describe each re­
source when creating it. Instead, these devices can automatically assign some
contextual metadata. Similarly, competitive pressures on vendors to provide
real-time and context-sensitive information services mandate automated collec­
tion of contextual information like location from mobile phones, portable book
readers and tablet computers.

Color Coded Library

Because he is presumably familiar with the contents of all of his books, in­
teraction designer Juhan Sonin organized his library according to their
spine colors. This organizing principle is a highly individual and aesthetic
one, but it would probably not appeal to people unfamiliar with the collec­
tion and would bring chaos to a library of larger size.

We might seek some optimal degree of description given some set of require­
ments or purposes for an organizing system and some estimate of the organiz­
ing effort that could be applied; in practice this is elusive for two reasons, both
relating to scope and scale. First, as the number of users of an organizing sys­

11.4 Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System

539

The Discipline of Organizing

tem increases, it becomes more difficult to identify and anticipate all its possible
purposes and constraints it must satisfy. Even if most users share the goals for
the organizing system, any particular user might have some additional special­
ized use for some attributes or relationships that would require more descrip­
tion to satisfy.636[Bus]
Second, even if it were possible to implement some optimal degree of descrip­
tion in a particular organizing system, we would still encounter problems when
multiple organizing systems exist in the same domain or in domains that inter­
sect across context, device, or application boundaries. Since organizing systems
are designed and evolve to satisfy the specific requirements of their particular
context, companies will often describe the same resources differently, which
creates integration and interoperability problems when companies need to ex­
change and combine information resources (§10.3.2).

11.4.3 About Intentional Arrangement
Organizing principles depend on resource descriptions, so requirements for the
former are always intertwined with those for the latter. Specifying requirements
for the intentional arrangement of resources is analogous to specifying why and
how resource categories can be created (§7.3). In turn, the creation of resource
categories often becomes a question about the number and kind of resource
properties that might be analyzed and exploited by organizing principles.
We noted that there is a continuum of category formation that ranges from mini­
mal use of resource properties to more rigorous use of multiple properties, and
finally to statistical or composite use of multiple properties, some of which are
induced or inferred rather than explicit. The simplest principle for defining a
category is by enumeration, just putting the resources into a set without any
specification of any properties they might share. The enumerated resources
might very well have common properties, but the principle of enumeration ig­
nores them; the only property that matters for that principle is that the resour­
ces are in the same set. This corresponds to the simplest principle of intentional
arrangement, that of collocation, just putting the resources in the same location
without any additional organization.
Collocated resources often acquire some additional arrangement as a result of
their use; consider how the books, papers, or other resources gathered for some
writing project often end up in piles in your office or on your desk close to your
work area. For a small collection, the proximity-to-use organizing principle is
the easiest way to satisfy a requirement to minimize the time to find frequently
used resources.
As we have often seen, the scope and scale of the organizing system is a domi­
nant design consideration and it applies to principles of resource arrangement
too. The collocation principle of arrangement is sufficient for small resource col­
540

Chapter 11 — The Organizing System Roadmap

Informatics Edition

lections because it is not necessary to define the optimal organization if the
time to find any particular resource is short even for an inefficient search meth­
od of scanning the entire collection. Using the extrinsic property of frequency of
use makes search slightly more efficient, but only in organizing systems where
the user population is small or interacts with the resources in similar ways. Oth­
erwise, arranging resources to facilitate their frequent access for some users
would hinder other users who never use them. Imagine if you shared your office
desk with someone who works all night on other writing projects and leaves his
frequently used resources in piles close to his work area—which becomes your
work area in the morning.
Larger resource collections usually require multiple organizing principles to
manage the complexity that emerges when more users and more varied interac­
tions must be supported. A valet parking lot might organize cars only by size to
make optimal use of limited space when parking and fetching them, but when
cars are organized for sale they would be organized by price, performance,
seating capacity, manufacturer, and many other properties. It is essential to es­
tablish the priority of users and interactions because these requirements deter­
mine the order in which the principles are applied to arrange the resources.
This ordering creates a logical resource hierarchy that affects the efficiency of
interactions and the maintenance of the organizing system over time.
Information resources are invariably challenging to arrange because their
aboutness is not an easily perceived property and because of the open-ended
purposes they can serve. Information collections with broad scope most often
use a standard system of bibliographic classification (§8.3). In contrast, special
libraries have narrower collections that need to support domain-specific interac­
tions for a relatively small set of users, and as a result they require more speci­
alized organizational schemes. The principles for resource arrangement in large
firms of every type are often required to conform with laws and regulations for
accounting, taxes, human resources, data retention and non retention, access
control, and other functions. (See §3.5.4.1, §8.1.5.4)

11.4.4 Dealing with Conflicting Requirements
Any individual, group, or enterprise can create an organizing system that meets
their specific requirements, but once this organizing system involves two or
more parties with different requirements, there is a potential for conflict. Room­
mates or spouses sometimes argue about how to organize items in the kitchen,
in the refrigerator, or in some other shared space. To a person who arranges
spices alphabetically and condiment jars by size, arranging them according to
cuisine or frequency of use makes no sense. Similarly, if you are the sole user of
a Dropbox or other cloud storage account, you can organize it any way you
want. You can use any number of folders that need only make sense to you, or
you can leave everything unorganized in a single folder. However, if you share
11.4 Identifying Requirements for an Organizing System

541

The Discipline of Organizing

the Dropbox account with another person, they are likely to have different or­
ganizational needs or preferences. Perhaps you tend to organize resources by
file type, while they prefer to organize resources by topic or project.
A small number of people can often agree on an organizing system that meets
the needs of each participant through informal negotiations. The potential for
conflict increases when more people are involved, and “bottom-up” ad hoc nego­
tiations to resolve every disagreement between every pair of participants just
are not feasible. In many domains conflicts are avoided or suppressed because
the parties have developed or agreed to conform to standards (§8.1.5). Never­
theless, conflicts in organizing principles for large-scale organizing systems are
often resolved by parties with the legal authority or economic power to impose
a solution on all the participants in a “top-down” manner.638[Bus]

11.5 Designing and Implementing an Organizing System
Requirements define what must be done but NOT how to do it; that’s the role of
the design and implementation phases. Being explicit about requirements and
the intended scope and scale of an organizing system before moving onto these
phases in an organizing system’s lifecycle avoids two problems. The first is tak­
ing a narrow and short-term focus on the initial resources in a collection, which
might not be representative of the collection when it reaches its planned scope
and scale. This can result in overly customized and inflexible resource descrip­
tions or arrangements that cannot easily accommodate the future growth of the
collection. A second problem, often a corollary of the first, is not separating de­
sign principles from their implementation in some specific environment or tech­
nology.

11.5.1 Choosing Scope- and Scale-Appropriate Technology
A simple organizing system to satisfy personal record keeping or some shortlived information management requirements can be implemented using folders
and files on a personal computer or by using “off the shelf” generic software
such as web forms, spreadsheets, databases, and wikis. Other simple organizing
systems run as applications on smart phones. Some small amount of configura­
tion, scripting, structuring or programming might be involved, but in many ca­
ses this work can be done in an ad hoc manner. The low initial cost to get star­
ted with these kinds of applications must be weighed against the possible cost
of having to redo a lot of the work later because the resources and the resource
descriptions might not be easily exported to new ones.
More capable organizing systems that enable the persistent storage and effi­
cient retrieval of large amounts of structured information resources generally
require additional design and implementation efforts. Flat word processing files
and spreadsheets are not adequate. Instead, XML document models and data­
542

Chapter 11 — The Organizing System Roadmap

Informatics Edition

base schemas often must be developed to ensure more control of and validation
of the information content and its descriptions. Software for version and config­
uration management, security and access control, query and transformation,
and for other functions and services must also be developed to implement the
organizing system.
Technology for organizing systems will always evolve to enable new capabilities.
For example, cloud computing and storage are radically changing the scale of
organizing systems and the accessibility of the information they contain. It
might be possible to implement these capabilities and services to an organizing
system in an incremental fashion with informal design and implementation
methods. If information models, processing logic, business rules and other con­
straints are encoded in the software without explicit traceability to require­
ments and design decisions the organizing system will be difficult to maintain if
the context, scope or requirements change. This is why we have repeatedly em­
phasized the importance of architectural thinking about organizing systems, be­
ginning in §1.6 where we proposed that organizing principles should ideally be
expressed in a way that did not assume how they would be implemented. (See
also §3.3.3.2, §8.1.3, and §9.1)

11.5.2 Architectural Thinking
Much of the advice about designing and implementing an organizing system can
be summarized as “architectural thinking,” introduced in §1.6. The overall pur­
pose of architectural thinking is to separate design issues from implementation
ones to make a system more robust and flexible. Architectural thinking leads to
more modularity and abstraction in design, making it easier to change an imple­
mentation to satisfy new requirements or to take advantage of new technologies
or procedures. It is also important to think architecturally about the design of
the vocabularies and schemas for resource description and of classification sys­
tems to leave room for expansion to accommodate new resource types (§7.5 and
§8.2.2.3). Doing so is easier if the descriptions are logically and physically dis­
tinct from the resources they describe. A checklist the brings together useful
principles and processes for architectural thinking from all parts of this book is
in the nearby sidebar.
Nevertheless, architectural thinking requires more careful analysis of resources
and implementation alternatives, and most people do not think this way, espe­
cially for personal and informal organizing systems. You can imagine that some­
one might arrange a collection of paperback books in a small bookcase whose
shelf height and width were perfectly suited for the paperbacks they currently
own. However, this organizing system would not work at all for large format
books, and a paperback could not be added to the collection unless one was
purged from the collection. It would be more sensible to start with a bigger

11.5 Designing and Implementing an Organizing System

The Discipline of Organizing

Principles and Processes for
Architectural Thinking
• Explicitly define the purposes
and users of the organizing sys­
tem, recognizing that users
might not agree on purposes or
their priorities (§2.3).
• Select resources (§3.2.1) and de­
sign interactions (§3.4.2) to sup­
port the primary or highest pri­
ority users.
• Specify information and interac­
tion requirements in a conceptu­
al and technology-neutral way
(§1.6) that conforms as much as
possible to domain standards,
schemas,
or
vocabularies
(§8.1.5).
• Implement user interactions
with design patterns to make
them more discoverable, usable,
and effective (§3.3.3.2).
• Follow principles for good
names (§4.4.3) and good re­
source descriptions (§5.3.4.1).
• Make an informed decision
about the tradeoff between flexi­
bility and complexity; a simpler
system might be easier to adapt
(§8.2.2.3).
• Make design and technology de­
cisions consistent with the ex­
pected life of the organizing sys­
tem (§11.6).

bookcase with adjustable shelves so
that the organizing system would
have a longer lifetime.
You might think that large institution­
al organizing systems would avoid
these problems caused by tying a col­
lection too tightly to the physical envi­
ronment in which it is initially organ­
ized, but sometimes they do not. A fa­
mous example involves the art collec­
tion of the Barnes Foundation, which
had to keep its paintings in the exact
same crowded arrangements when
the museum made a controversial
move from a small building to a larger
one because the donor had mandated
that the paintings never be moved
from their original settings. (See the
sidebar, The Barnes Collection (page
546)).
For digital resources, inexpensive
storage and high bandwidth have
largely eliminated capacity as a con­
straint for organizing systems, with
an exception for big data, which is de­
fined as a collection of data that is too
big to be managed by typical data­
base software and hardware architec­
tures.639[Com] Even so, big data collec­
tions are often large but homogene­
ous, so their scale is not their most
important challenge from an organiz­
ing system perspective (§11.3.1).

11.5.3 Distinguishing Access
from Control

Because large resource collections
are often used for multiple purposes
by many different people or projects, they illustrate another important architec­
tural issue for collections of digital resources. A requirement for access to re­
sources does not imply a need to directly own or control them, and informationintensive and web-based businesses have increasingly adopted organizing

Stop and Think: What is a
Library?
The word “library” has several
meanings that differ in how much
architectural thinking they embody.
When you tell someone you will
meet them at the library for a cup
of coffee and a study session it is a
specific physical place. At other
times you might use a more ab­
stract notion of a library as an or­
ganizing system with a predictable
type of collection, resource ar­
rangement, and supported interac­
tions. Both meanings are important
for a city creating a new library.
How would you ensure that both
are considered in an effective way?

system designs that involve storage of
digital resources in the cloud, licens­
ing of globally distributed resources,
and outsourcing of information serv­
ices. Designs that use these architec­
tural concepts can realize functional
and quality improvements because
the location and identity of the serv­
ice provider is hidden by an abstrac­
tion layer (§3.4.2.1, §4.4.3.5). Howev­
er, separating access from ownership
has been a cultural challenge for
some libraries and museums whose
institutional identities emphasize the
resources they directly control and
the physical buildings in which they
control them.

11.5.4 Standardization and
Legacy Considerations

As we noted with the Barnes Collection, a building becomes old and outdated
over time. The technology used in digital organizing systems becomes obsolete
faster than physical buildings do. The best way to slow the inevitable transfor­
mation of today’s cutting edge technology to tomorrow’s legacy technology is to
design with standard data formats, description vocabularies and schemas, and
classification systems unless you have specific requirements that preclude these
choices.
Even a requirement to interoperate with an organizing system that uses propri­
etary or non-standard specifications can usually be satisfied by transforming
from a standard format (§8.1.5.2, §10.4). Similarly, it is better to design the APIs
and data feeds of an organizing system in a generic or standard way that ab­
stracts from their hidden implementation. This design principle makes it easier
for external users to understand the supported interactions, and also prevents
disclosure of any aspects of resource description or organization that provide
competitive advantage. For example, the way in which a business classifies
products, suppliers, customers, or employees can be competitively important.
Two important design questions that arise with data transformation or conver­
sion, whether it is required by a technology upgrade or an interoperability re­
quirement, are when to do it and where to do it. The job of converting all the
resources in a collection can typically be outsourced to a firm that specializes in
format conversion or resource description, and a batch or pre-emptive conver­
sion of an entire collection enables an upgraded or new organizing system to

The Barnes Collection
Albert Barnes was a chemist who made a fortune inventing a preventive
treatment for gonorrhea and who then amassed perhaps the greatest pri­
vate art collection ever, one that contained over 800 paintings by artists like
Picasso, Renoir, Matisse, van Gogh, and Cezanne. In 1922 Barnes built a
museum for his collection in his residential neighborhood in Merion, PA, a
suburb of Philadelphia. Barnes did not open his collection to the public and
in his will mandated that the collection never be moved, loaned, or sold.
In the decades after Barnes died in 1951 the Merion museum needed exten­
sive repairs and security upgrades, and some people suggested that its re­
mote location and access restrictions jeopardized its financial viability. How­
ever, a proposal to relocate the collection to Philadelphia seemingly violated
the terms of the Barnes will.
A legal fight dragged on for decades. Finally in 2004 a judge ruled that the
collection could be moved to Philadelphia, but only if the new museum con­
tained exact copies of the gallery rooms of the original museum and ar­
ranged the paintings exactly as they were in Merion. The new museum
building, opened in 2012, is ten times larger than the old one, but the col­
lection takes up the same space as it did in Merion. The other 90% of the
building is occupied by an auditorium, offices, classrooms, a gift shop, and
other space that contains none of the collection.
operate more efficiently when it is not distracted by ongoing conversion activity.
On the other hand, if resources vary greatly in their frequency of use, a “do-ityourself on-demand” method is probably more cost effective as long as the con­
version does not impact the interactions that need to be supported.

11.6 Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System
After the organizing system has been designed and implemented it can be put
into its operation and maintenance phases. We will look at these from two per­
spectives, first from the point of view of individual resources, and then from the
point of view of the organizing system’s design and implementation. These two
perspectives are not always clearly distinguished. Curation, for example, is of­
ten used to describe actions taken to maintain individual resources as well as
those that result in new arrangements of them.

11.6.1 Resource Perspective
Sometimes an organizing system is implemented with its organizing structures
and relationships waiting to be populated by resources as they are acquired and
described. The scope and scale of the organizing system shapes how the de­
546

Chapter 11 — The Organizing System Roadmap

Informatics Edition

scriptions are created and how the descriptions are then used to assign resour­
ces to the logical or physical containers of the organizing system. The most im­
portant decisions to be made at this point involve determining an appropriate
mix of methods for creating the resource descriptions, because their cost, quali­
ty, consistency, completeness, and semantic richness depends on which human
or computational agents do the work (§5.3.6).
For web-based and consumer-focused organizing systems, it is tempting to rely
on users to assign descriptions, tags, or ratings to resources (§5.2.2.3). Some of
these systems attempt to improve the quality and precision of these descriptions
by providing forms, controlled vocabularies, or suggestions. Finding a balance
is tricky; too much direction and control is demotivating to uncompensated vol­
unteer describers, and too little of it results in the proverbial “tag soup.”
An essential operational and maintenance activity is evaluation of resource de­
scriptions, first with respect to the time and process by which they are created,
and second with respect to how and when they support the designed interac­
tions (§5.3.7).
Some organizing systems are initiated with a fixed set of resources that will not
change in any way. For example, in an archive as most narrowly defined, neither
the individual resources nor the organization of the collection as a whole will
change. If an archive of Abraham Lincoln letters is established, we know that
Lincoln will never revise any letters or write any new ones, and any new classifi­
cations or descriptions devised by people studying the archive will not be used
to rearrange the letters.
Most organizing systems, however, need to support ongoing interactions with a
collection that changes over time as new resources enter the collection and old
ones leave. These selection and collection management processes are explicit in
libraries, museums and similar institutions that maintain collections to satisfy
the changing needs and preferences of their user communities (§3.2.2).

11.6.2 Properties, Principles and Technology Perspective
It is useful to consider how an organizing system as a whole is operated and
maintained over time. We can analyze how the system’s organizing properties,
principles and technology might change, and we can roughly order different
types of change according to their overall impact.
The most predictable maintenance activities for an organizing system with an
expected long lifetime (§11.3.3) are incremental changes in description vocabu­
laries and classification schemes (§8.2.2.3). These need to evolve when new in­
stances or contexts require additional properties to maintain the distinctions be­
tween types of resources, but the basic principles embodied in the organizing
systems are not affected.

11.6 Operating and Maintaining an Organizing System

547

The Discipline of Organizing

Incremental category maintenance takes place even in personal organizing sys­
tems where the categories are not always explicit. The collection of clothes in a
college student’s closet and the categories and properties for arranging them
will change somewhat when he graduates and takes a job in a downtown office
building where he needs to dress more formally than he did as a student. He
will learn that despite the common term in the category name, “student casual”
and “business casual” do not contain the same sets of resources.
Category maintenance is an ongoing activity in institutional organizing systems.
The most commonly used bibliographic classification systems all have number­
ing and naming schemes that allow for subdivision and extension to create new
subcategories to accommodate resources about new fields of knowledge and
technology.
As another example, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) professio­
nal society created a keyword classification in 1964 to organize articles in its
many publications, but relentless change in the computing field driven by
Moore’s Law has required the ACM to significantly revise the system almost ev­
ery decade.642[Com]
In contrast, changes in business organizing systems are more likely to be driven
by economic factors. Resource properties for managing collections of resource
and the information that describes them often change over time as a result of
new products and services, mergers and acquisitions, or refined customer seg­
mentation. More substantial changes in business organizing systems reflect the
need to comply with laws and regulations that impose new requirements for
tracing money flows or transactions. These mandated classifications and pro­
cesses might require new organizing principles, not just incremental properties
(§8.1.5.4).
The choice of implementation technology influences how easy it is to handle
these types of changes in organizing systems. In databases this problem is
known as “schema migration.” With XML implementations, schemas can be de­
signed with “extension” or “codelist” elements to enable changes that will not
invalidate existing information. Business processes that are driven by “executa­
ble specifications” like the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) can be
easily modified because the BPEL XML instance is used to configure the soft­
ware that carries out the process it describes.643[Com]
Another very predictable type of activity over time with organizing systems is a
technology upgrade that improves its quality or capabilities without affecting
the organizing principles. A student might replace his handwritten lecture notes
with typed notes on a laptop or tablet computer but not significantly change the
way the notes are organized.

548

Chapter 11 — The Organizing System Roadmap

Informatics Edition

Institutional organizing systems are adopting tiered storage systems that auto­
matically move resources between different types of storage media to meet per­
formance, availability and recovery requirements. For example, firms with high
financial impact of downtime like banks run critical organizing systems with
copies in “failsafe” or “hot” modes that are synchronized with the production
environments to prevent any interruptions in information access if the latter are
disrupted. On the other hand, resources needed for regulatory compliance can
be kept on lower cost disk storage.
The most challenging kinds of maintenance activities for organizing systems in­
volve changes to the principles for arranging resources along with changes in
the implementing technology. An example is the ambitious effort to introduce
semantic web and linked data concepts in bibliographic organizing systems
(§6.8.2, §9.4.3). And change comes faster to businesses than to libraries and mu­
seums. New technologies can have a disruptive impact on business organizing
system, forcing major changes to enable strategy changes that involve faster
finding, retrieval, or delivery of informational or physical goods.644[Com]
Sometimes major changes to organizing principles and technologies can be in­
troduced incrementally, with changes “rolled out” to different sets of resources
or user groups during a transition period. However, sometimes the changes are
inherently ”all or none” because it is impossible to have two conflicting organiz­
ing systems operating in the same context. An easy to understand example of an
organizing system that changed radically is the system governing which side of
the road you drive on, which was changed in Samoa in 2009. (See the sidebar,
Driving in Samoa (page 550)).

11.7 Key Points in Chapter Eleven
• Most of the specific decisions that must be made for an organizing system
are shaped by the initial decisions about its domain, scope, and scale.
(See §11.2 The Organizing System Lifecycle (page 529))
• The impact of broad scope arises more from the heterogeneity of the resour­
ces and users in a collection rather than from their absolute number.
(See §11.3.1 Scope and Scale of the Collection (page 530))
• Larger collections need more people to organize and maintain them, creat­
ing communication and coordination problems that grow much faster than
the collection.
(See §11.3.1 Scope and Scale of the Collection (page 530))
• Standardization is the best way to prevent problems of scope and scale.

Whether you travel by bus, car, or bicycle, you always keep to one side of
the road. The convention of driving on either the right side or the left side is
a legal standard that everyone takes for granted. However, you must follow
it to ensure safe driving and avoid collisions and crashes.
This standard of which side of the road you drive on was not decided arbi­
trarily, but rather, it was adopted as a result of history, convention, and the
need for organization. If you were the only person to use the road, you
could choose to travel on any side you wanted, even travel right down the
middle. As soon as more than one person needs to use the same road, the
risk of collisions compels the creation of a coordinating standard.
In 2009, the government of Samoa took the rare step of changing the side of
the road standard from driving on the right to driving on the left. The origi­
nal standard reflected the influence of German colonization in the early
1900s. However, Samoa is both geographically close to and economically in­
tertwined with Australia and New Zealand, former British colonies that fol­
low the British convention of driving on the left side. This proximity gives
Samoa access to a nearby source of used cars that would be attractive to
Samoa’s relatively poor population. So, the Samoan government decided to
use its authority to change the driving standard so that more of its people
could afford to buy cars.
As one could imagine, this decision was not implemented without controver­
sy and opposition. While the decision benefited people currently without
cars, it negatively affected those who already owned them. After a switch
like this, what happens to the current market value of the thousands of cars
designed to drive on the right? Opponents also claimed that the switch
would cause unprecedented safety hazards. If even a small fraction of driv­
ers were not able to immediately get the hang of driving on the other side,
the accident rate could increase tremendously. Imagine the current pool of
buses designed with doors that open on the right hand side—would they
now let passengers out in the middle of the street? Who would pay to have
the buses modified to put doors on the left hand side?645[Bus]
• Organizing systems in the same domain and with nominally the same scope
can differ substantially in the resources they contain and the interactions
they support if they have different categories of users.
(See §11.3.2 Number and Nature of Users (page 532))

ple should commit to measures of transparency and an ongoing process of

negotiation that enables those affected to voice concerns related to any det­
rimental effects the technology might have on them and their communities.
(See §11.3.2 Number and Nature of Users (page 532))
• For most organizing systems other than personal ones, the set of interac­
tions that are implemented in an organizing system is strongly determined
by economic factors.
(See §11.4.1 Requirements for Interactions (page 536))
• An essential requirement in every organizing system is ensuring that the
supported interactions can be discovered and invoked by their intended
users.
(See §11.4.1 Requirements for Interactions (page 536))
• Automated and computerized processes can create the resource descrip­
tions in an organizing system and their use is primarily driven by scale.
(See §11.4.2 About the Nature and Extent of Resource Description (page
537))
• Organizing principles depend on resource descriptions, so requirements for
the former are always intertwined with those for the latter.
(See §11.4.3 About Intentional Arrangement (page 540))
• Overly customized and inflexible resource descriptions or arrangements can­
not easily accommodate the future growth of the collection.
(See §11.5 Designing and Implementing an Organizing System (page 542))
• Architectural thinking leads to more modularity and abstraction in design,
making it easier to change an implementation to satisfy new requirements
or to take advantage of new technologies or procedures.
(See §11.5.2 Architectural Thinking (page 543))
• For digital resources, inexpensive storage and high bandwidth have largely
eliminated capacity as a constraint for organizing systems, with an excep­
tion for big data, which is defined as a collection of data that is too big to be
managed by typical database software and hardware architectures.
(See §11.5.2 Architectural Thinking (page 543))
• The most predictable maintenance activities for an organizing system with
an expected long lifetime are incremental changes in description vocabula­
ries and classification schemes.
Another very predictable type of activity over time with organizing systems
is a technology upgrade that improves its quality or capabilities without af­
fecting the organizing principles.
(See §11.6.2 Properties, Principles and Technology Perspective (page 547))

The Discipline of Organizing

• The most challenging kinds of maintenance activities for organizing systems
involve changes to the principles for arranging resources along with
changes in the implementing technology.
(See §11.6.2 Properties, Principles and Technology Perspective (page 547))
• What resources are being organized? Why are the resources being organ­
ized? Who does the organizing? When are the resources organized? Where
are the resources organized? How much are the resources organized?
(See the case studies presented in Chapter 12, Case Studies)

Endnotes for Chapter 11
For some kinds of resources with highly regular structure, the distinc­
tion between the resource and its description is a bit arbitrary. A transactional
document like a payment contains at its core a specification of the amount paid,
which we could consider the payment resource. Information about the payer,
the payee, the reason for the payment, and other essential information might be
viewed as descriptions of the payment resource. In a payment or financial man­
agement system, the entire document might be treated as the resource.
[623][Com]

The results of this analysis can be represented in a conceptual model or
document /database schema that can guide the automated creation of the re­
source instances and their descriptions (§5.3.1.2). Furthermore, these models or
schemas can also be used in “model-based” or “model-driven” architectures to
generate much of the software that implements the functionality to store the in­
stances and interchange them with other information systems; “imagine if the
construction worker could take his blueprint, crank it through a machine, and
have the foundation for the building simply appear.” Quote comes from (Miller
and Mukerji 2003). See also (Kleppe, Warmer, and Bast 2003).

Model-driven software generation can be simple—an XFORM specifica­
tion that creates an input form on a web page. Or it can be complex—a detailed
architectural specification in UML sufficient to generate a complete application.

Service design, architecture, and user interaction design are the primary
disciplines that care about the influence of layout and spatial arrangement on
user interaction behavior and satisfaction. One type of physical framework is
the “Servicescape” (Bitner 1992), the man-made physical context in which serv­
ices are delivered. For example, the arrangement of waiting lines in banks, su­

permarkets, and post offices or the use of centrally-visible “take a number” sys­
tems strongly influence the encounters in service systems (Zhou and Soman
2003). Related concepts for describing the use of features and orienting mecha­
nisms in “the built environment” come from the “Wayfinding” (Arthur and Passi­
ni 1992) literature in urban planning and architecture.
An easy to remember framework for prioritizing requirements is MoS­
CoW, which classifies them as Must, Should, Could, and Won’t (Desoky 2010).
(Winkler and Pilgrim 2010) is a comprehensive review of academic research and
best practices for requirements traceability.
[630][Bus]

“Customer segments” or “customer models” are well-established con­
structs in product and service marketing and operations (Batt 2000) (Zeithami,
Rust, and Lemon 2001). They are key parts of strategies for acquiring custom­
ers, increasing market share, and retaining customers. Customer segments can
be identified using numerous overlapping criteria, including demographic varia­
bles, product or behavior choices, and preferred interaction locations or chan­
nels. For example, an airline might segment its customers according to their
age, gender, home airport, ticketing class, and travel frequency.
[631][Bus]

Organizing systems differ in the extent they can initiate interactions or
use information to make them unnecessary. In libraries the organizing systems
are typically designed not to preserve user activity records longer than abso­
lutely necessary; in commercial organizing systems, user activity records are
the basis of business processes that create highly detailed user models (called
“microsegments” or “microcategories”) that enable personalized product and
service offerings See (Taylor and Raden 2007), (Rosen 2012).
[633][Bus]

For example, we have often used a home kitchen as a setting for organiz­
ing systems. Suppose the home kitchen is to be used as the set for a cooking
show and the designers want to arrange cookbooks to make the background vis­
ually pleasing. The designers would like to search for cookbooks on the basis of
size and spine color, but these descriptive elements would be of little value to
other users.
[636][Bus]

Some people call this the “Wal-Mart approach” to standardization. A firm
with dominant market power does not need to negotiate standards because it
can impose whatever standards it chooses on its partners as a condition of do­
ing business with them. When there are conflicting requirements, different rela­
tionships within the set of participants trying to reach agreement, and different
extents to which they are subject to the authority behind the desired agree­
ment, it is not surprising that approaches “that require perfect coordination and
altruism are of no practical interest” (Rosenthal et al. 2004, p 47).

such as some number of terabytes (thousands of gigabytes). This allows the

threshold size that makes a collection a big data one to increase as storage
technology advances. It also recognizes that different industries or domains
have different thresholds (Manyika et al 2011).
No classification scheme ever devised is as unstable as the ACM’s be­
cause new computing concepts, technologies, and application areas are con­
stantly emerging. Even the society’s name seems outdated.

This means that the organizing systems used by business applications
more often employ configuration management, version control, model-based

need for qualitative changes in the organizing systems.

Overview
We now fulfill the promise of this book, with a set of case study examples that
apply the concepts and phases of the roadmap. (The first four case studies ap­
peared in the first print edition of the book. All the others have been contrib­
uted by students or other readers of the book and edited for consistency.——
Ed.)

The Discipline of Organizing

Case Study Template
For the sake of consistency, we employ the questions posed in Chapter 2, Design
Decisions in Organizing Systems as a template for the case studies. We remind
you of six groups of design decisions, itemizing the most important dimensions
in each group:
• What is being organized? What is the scope and scale of the domain? What
is the mixture of physical things, digital things, and information about things
in the organizing system? Is the organizing system being designed to create
a new resource collection, catalog an existing and closed resource collec­
tion, or manage a collection in which resources are continually added or de­
leted? Are the resources unique, or are they interchangeable members of a
category? Do they follow a predictable “life cycle” with a “useful life”? Does
the organizing system use the interaction resources created through its use,
or are these interaction resources extracted and aggregated for use by an­
other organizing system? (§2.2)
• Why is it being organized? What interactions or services will be supported,
and for whom? Are the uses and users known or unknown? Are the users pri­
marily people or computational processes? Does the organizing system need
to satisfy personal, social, or institutional goals? (§2.3)
• How much is it being organized? What is the extent, granularity, or explicit­
ness of description, classification, or relational structure being imposed?
What organizing principles guide the organization? Are all resources organ­
ized to the same degree, or is the organization sparse and non-uniform?
(§2.4)
• When is it being organized? Is the organization imposed on resources when
they are created, when they become part of the collection, when interactions
occur with them, just in case, just in time, all the time? Is any of this organ­
izing mandated by law or shaped by industry practices or cultural tradition?
(§2.5)
• How or by whom, or by what computational processes, is it being organ­
ized? Is the organization being performed by individuals, by informal groups,
by formal groups, by professionals, by automated methods? Are the organiz­
ers also the users? Are there rules or roles that govern the organizing activi­
ties of different individuals or groups? (§2.6)
• Where is it being organized? Is the resource location constrained by design
or by regulation? Are the resources positioned in a static location? Are the
resources in transit or in motion? Does their location depend on other pa­
rameters, such as time? (§2.7)

556

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

As we discussed in §2.7 Where is it being Organized? (page 81), when location is
a constraint, it will typically be identified as such in the other questions. As re­
sult, we will only examine “Where?” as distinct design dimension in cases where
it is warranted.

12.1 A Multi-generational Photo Collection
Overview. Your grandfather has died, at age 91, and under his bed is a suitcase
containing several photo albums with a few hundred photos. Some of them have
captions, but many do not. What do you do with them?
Your first thought was to create a digital photo archive of Grandpa’s collection
so that you and all your relatives could see them, and you would also want to
generate accurate captions where none exist. Since you have an extensive digi­
tal photo collection of your own in a web-based application, perhaps you can
combine the two collections to create a multi-generational photo organizing sys­
tem.
This project involves digitization, archiving, social media issues, and negotia­
tions with and collecting information from other family members who might
have different views about what to do.
What is being organized? It is easy to find advice about how to digitize old pho­
tos, but there are more choices than you might think. What resolution and for­
mat should you use? Should you do the work yourself or send Grandpa’s pre­
cious photos to a service and take the risk that they might get lost? Should you
do any restoration or enhancement of the photos as part of the digitization proc­
ess?646[CogSci]
More fundamental design questions concern the scope and scale of the organiz­
ing system. If you are digitizing Grandpa’s photos and combining them with
yours, you are skipping a generation. Should not you also include photos from
your parents and the rest of Grandpa’s children? That generation has both prin­
ted photos and digital ones, but it is not as comfortable with computers as you
are, and their digital photos are stored less systematically on a variety of CDROM, DVDs, flash memory sticks, and SD photo cards, making the digitizing
and organizing work more complicated. Do these differences in storage media
reflect an intentional arrangement that needs to be preserved? And what about
that box full of Super 8 cartridges and VHS tapes with family videos on them,
and the audio cassettes with recordings made at long-ago family gatherings?
A family history management system that includes many different resource
types is a much bigger project than the one you contemplated when you first
opened Grandpa’s suitcase. It is easier to consider using separate but related
organizing systems for each media type, because there are many web-based ap­
plications you could use. In fact, there are far too many choices of web applica­
12.1 A Multi-generational Photo Collection

557

The Discipline of Organizing

tions for you to consider. You might compare some for their functionality and us­
ability, but given the long expected lifetime of your organizing system there are
more critical considerations: whether the site is likely to last as long as your col­
lection and, if it does not, how easily you can export your resources and re­
source descriptions.647[Web]
Why is it being organized? The overall goal of preserving Grandpa’s photos
needs no justification, but is preservation the primary goal? Or, rather, is to ena­
ble access to the images for far-flung family members? Or is it to create a repo­
sitory for family photos as they continue to be produced? Alternatively, is it less
about the images themselves and perhaps more about collecting family history
information contained in the photos, thus making the collection of metadata (ac­
curate information about when and where the photo was taken, who is in it,
etc.) most important?
These decisions determine requirements for the interactions that the photo or­
ganizing system must support, but the repertoire of interactions is mostly deter­
mined by the choice of photo storage and sharing application. Some applica­
tions combine photo storage in a cloud-based repository tied to a very powerful
set of digital photography tools, but this functionality comes with complexity
that would overwhelm your less technology-savvy relatives. They would be hap­
py just to be able to browse and search for photos.
How much is it being organized? Because you realize that a carefully designed
set of categories and a controlled tagging vocabulary will enable precise brows­
ing and search, you chose an application that supports grouping and tagging.
But not everyone should be allowed to group or tag photos, and maybe some of
the more distant relatives can view photos but not add any.
Will your categories and tags include all of those that Grandpa used when he ar­
ranged pictures in albums and made notes on the back of many of them? Do you
want to allow annotations? Maybe this is a picture from a vacation; if you go
back to the same place, do you want to create an association between the pic­
tures?
Do not forget to keep Grandpa’s original albums in a safe place, not under a bed
somewhere.
When is it being organized? Once you create your categories and tags, you can
require people to use them when they add new photos to the collection. Perhaps
the existing resource descriptions can be completed or enhanced as a collective
activity at a family reunion. Do not put this off too long—the people who can
identify Grandpa’s sister Gladys, her second husband, and his sister in an un­
captioned photo are getting on in years.
How or by whom is it being organized? You have taken on the role of the editor
and curator, but you cannot do everything and having a group of people in­
558

volved will probably result in more robust organizing. A group can also better
handle sticky situations like what to do if people get divorced or have a falling
out with other family members; do pictures taken of or by them get deleted?
Other considerations. Maintenance of this collection for an indefinite time rai­
ses the important issue or a succession plan for the curator. If only one name is
on the account and only that person knows the password, you run the risk of
losing access to the photos if that person dies. One of Grandpa’s mistakes was
dying without clearly specifying his intentions for his photo collection, so what­
ever you decide you should document carefully and include a continuity plan
when you are no longer the curator.648[Law]

12.2 Knowledge Management for a Small Consulting Firm
Overview. A senior professor who has done part-time consulting for many years
is very pleased when his latest book becomes a best-seller and he is inundated
with new consulting opportunities. He decides to take a two-year leave of ab­
sence from his university to start a small consulting firm with several of his cur­
rent and former graduate students as his junior consulting partners.
An organizing system for knowledge management is required, but what gets de­
signed will depend on the scoping decision. Is the goal of the system to support
the consulting business, or also to support ongoing and future research projects
that sooner or later will generate the consulting opportunities?
What is being organized? The professor concludes that since his consulting is
based on his research, he needs to include in the new knowledge management
system his research articles and the raw and analyzed data that is discussed in
the articles. These resources are already organized to a great extent according
to the research project that led to their creation. These have been kept in the
professor’s university office.
The professor also has a separate collection of consulting proposals, client re­
ports, and presentations that he has made at client firms. Because of restrictive
university rules about faculty consulting, the professor has always kept these
resources in his home office rather than on campus.649[Law]
In addition to these existing resource types, it will be necessary to create new
ones that make systematic and explicit information that the professor has man­
aged in an informal and largely tacit manner. This includes consulting inquiries,
information about prospects, and information about specific people in client
firms.
Why is it being organized? The professor has usually just done one consulting
project at a time, very opportunistically. He has often turned down projects that
involved more work than he could do himself. He now sees the opportunity to do

12.2 Knowledge Management for a Small Consulting Firm

559

The Discipline of Organizing

much more consulting and to take on more significant projects if he can lever­
age his expertise in a more efficient way.
The professor can take on the “rainmaker” role to secure new consulting en­
gagements and make the important decisions, and he is confident that he can
train and support his new staff of current and former students to do much of the
actual consulting work.
The knowledge management system must enable everyone in the firm to access
and contribute to project repositories that contain proposals, plans, work in pro­
gress, and project deliverables. Much of this work can be reused from one
project to another, increasing the productivity of the firm and the quality of its
deliverables.650[Bus]
Just as it is essential that the professor’s knowledge is systematized and made
available via a knowledge management system, so must the knowledge created
by the new staff of consultants. The professor cannot expect that all of the stu­
dents will work for him forever, so any knowledge that they acquire and create
in the course of their work will be lost to the firm unless it is captured along
with the professor’s.
The consulting firm probably will not have an indefinite lifetime. After his leave
of absence, the professor might return to his university duties, perhaps on a
part-time basis. The knowledge management system will enable him to leave
the firm in someone else’s hands while enabling him to keep tabs on and possi­
bly contribute to ongoing projects. Alternatively, if the firm is doing very well,
perhaps the professor will resign his university position and take on the role of
growing the firm. A larger consultancy might want to acquire the professor’s
firm, and the firm’s valuation will in part be determined be the extent to which
the firm’s capabilities and resources are documented in the knowledge manage­
ment system.
How much is it being organized? A small firm has neither the money nor the
people to invest in complex technology and a rigorous process for knowledge
management, but appropriate technology is readily available and affordable. De­
cisions about organizing principles must be made that reflect the mix of consult­
ing projects; resources might be organized in a shared file system by customer
type, project type, the lead consultant, or all of these ways using a faceted clas­
sification approach.
Standard document templates and style sheets for the resource types created
by consultants can be integrated into word processors and spreadsheets. Con­
tact and customer management functionality can be licensed as a hosted appli­
cation.
Many small teams make good use of wikis for knowledge management because
they are very flexible in the amount of structure they impose.651[Bus]
560

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

When is it being organized? The professor’s decision to take a leave of absence
reflects his belief that getting the firm started quickly is essential if he is to cap­
italize on his recent bestselling book to generate consulting business. This
makes managing the prospect pipeline and the proposal-writing process the
highest priority targets for knowledge management.
Much of the other organizing work can emerge as adjuncts to consulting
projects if some effort is made to coordinate the organizing across projects.
How or by whom is it being organized? Because many of the early organizing
decisions have implications for the types of customers and projects that the firm
can take on, only the professor is capable of making most of them. The principal
goal of the knowledge management system is to enable the professor to dele­
gate work to his consulting staff, so he needs to enlist them in the design of the
organizing system to ensure it is effective.
Other considerations. As the consulting firm grows, it is inevitable that some
consultants will be better than others at creating and using knowledge to create
customer value, and they will expect to be compensated accordingly. It is essen­
tial for the ongoing success of the firm not to let this create disincentives for
knowledge capture and sharing between consultants. The solution is to develop
a company culture that promotes and rewards them.652[Bus]

12.3 Smarter Farming in Japan
Overview. Unlike the first two case studies, this is an actual case rather than a
hypothetical or composite one. It shares with the first two cases a focus on pre­
serving valuable resources but in the radically different domain of farming.
This case concerns an initiative by Fujitsu, a Japanese technology firm, to apply
“smart computing” and lean manufacturing techniques to the agricultural sec­
tor, which lags in technology use. Fujitsu is testing a “farm work management
system” at six Japanese farms. In this case study we will focus on the farm high­
lighted in a 2011 Wall Street Journal story.653[Bus]
This test farm is located in southern Japan. It has 60 different crops spread over
100 hectares (about 250 acres), an area slightly larger than the central campus
of the University of California at Berkeley.
What is being organized? Sensors are deployed in each of 300 different farm
plots to collect readings on temperature, soil, and moisture levels. Video cam­
eras also monitor each plot.
The 72 relatively unskilled workers on the farm are also managed resources.
Each of them carries a mobile phone for communication, transmission of pic­
tures, and GPS tracking of their location.

12.3 Smarter Farming in Japan

561

The Discipline of Organizing

Why is it being organized? The highest-level goal for Fujitsu is to expand its
reach as a technology firm by applying the concepts of lean manufacturing, stat­
istical process control, and continual improvement to new domains. Farming is
an obvious choice in Japan because it is a relatively unproductive sector where
the average age is over sixty. It is essential that farms use more computing ca­
pability to increase efficiency and to capture and reuse the scarce knowledge
possessed by aging workers.
The Fujitsu farm work management system supports numerous types of interac­
tions to achieve these goals. For example, workers can send pictures of infected
crops for diagnosis by an expert farmer in the farm’s office, who can then inves­
tigate further by studying recorded video from the affected plot.
As more farms deploy the Fujitsu system, the aggregated knowledge and sensor
information can be analyzed to enable economies of scale that will allow sepa­
rate and widely distributed farms to function as if they were all part of a single
large firm with centralized management.654[Bus]
How much is it being organized? The current design of the system treats farm
workers as relatively passive resources that are managed very closely. The sys­
tem generates a daily schedule of planting, maintenance, harvesting, and other
activities for each worker. At a daily wrap-up meeting the farm manager reviews
each worker’s performance based on GPS and sensor readings.
The sensor data is analyzed and organized extensively by Fujitsu computers to
make recommendations, both agricultural ones (e.g., what crop grows best in
each plot and the work schedule that optimizes quality and yield) and business
ones (the profitability of growing this crop on this plot of land).
When is it being organized? The farm work management system is continually
organizing and reorganizing what it knows about the farm as it analyzes sensor
and production information. In contrast, the information created by the workers
is captured but its analysis is deferred to an expert.
It is conceivable that as the farm workers become more expert as a result of the
guidance and instruction they receive from the system that they can be more
autonomous and do more analysis and interpretation on their own. It is also
likely that the inexorable forces of Moore’s law will enable more data collection
and more processing of the sensor data at its time of collection, which might re­
sult in increased real-time information exchange with the workers.
How or by whom is it being organized? The physical organization of the farm,
with 300 small plots of land with 60 different fruits and vegetables, is the legacy
arrangement of the farm before the Fujitsu trial began. Because of the sizable
investment that Fujitsu has made in the farm to deploy the system, it is likely
that the farm manager defers to recommendations made by the system to
change crop arrangements. So it is reasonable to conclude that most of the de­
562

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

cisions about the organizing system are made by computational processes rath­
er than by people.
Other considerations. Fujitsu built this system for managing farms, but there
are several other resource domains with similar challenges about capturing and
reusing operational knowledge: vineyards, forests, and fish farms come to
mind.655[Com] It will be interesting to see if the farm work management system
can be made more abstract and configurable so that the same system can be
used in all of these domains.
Farm crops, vineyards, trees, and fish pens do not move around, so a more chal­
lenging application of sensor technologies arises with cattle herd management.
Nevertheless, sensors inserted in the genitals of a female dairy cow can trigger
a text message to a herd manager’s cell phone when the cow is in heat, prevent­
ing the economic loss of missing a reproductive cycle.656[Ling]
Somewhat more remote domains for potential application of systems that com­
bine sensor networks with workforce management include sales, field support,
and logistics.

12.4 Single-Source Textbook Publishing
Overview. The fourth case is also an actual case—a self-referential one. It is a
case study about the organizing system involved in the creation, production,
and distribution of The Discipline of Organizing. See (Glushko 2015).
We have known since the beginning of this project that this book should not just
be a conventional text. A printed book is an intellectual snapshot that is already
dated in many respects the day it is published. In addition, the pedagogical goal
of The Discipline of Organizing as a textbook for information schools and similar
programs is made more difficult by the relentless growth of computing capabili­
ty and the resulting technology innovation in our information-intensive economy
and culture. We think that the emergence of ebook publishing opens up innova­
tive possibilities as long as we can use a single set of source files to produce and
update the print and digital versions of this book.
What is being organized? The content of this book began in early 2010 as more
than 1000 slides and associated instructor notes for a graduate course “Infor­
mation Organizing and Retrieval” that Robert J. Glushko, the primary author
and editor of The Discipline of Organizing, was teaching at the University of
California, Berkeley. These slides and notes were created in XML and trans­
formed to HTML for presentation in a web browser.657[Com]
The first decision to be made about resource organization led to the iterative
sorting of the slides from 26 lectures into the 10 chapters in the initial outline
for the book. The second decision concerned the granularity of the new content

12.4 Single-Source Textbook Publishing

563

The Discipline of Organizing

resources being created for the book. The team of authors was organized by
chapters, which made chapters the natural granularity for file management and
version control. Because authors were widely dispersed we relied on the Drop­
box cloud storage service to synchronize work. Nevertheless, the broad and
deep topical coverage of the book meant that chapters had substantial internal
structure (four levels of headings in some places), and many of these subsec­
tions became separately identified resources that moved from chapter to chap­
ter until they found their natural home.
In addition to the text content and illustrations that make up the printed text,
we needed to organize short videos, interactive examples, and other applica­
tions to incorporate in digital versions of the book.
Finally, it has been essential to view the software that transforms, assembles,
formats, and assigns styles when turning source files into deliverable artifacts
as resources that must be managed. For the first and second editions of the
book, we were fortunate to get much of the software required to build both
print and ebooks from O’Reilly and Associates, an innovative technology pub­
lisher that has been developing a single-source publishing system called Atlas.
Because we have recently been experimenting with including richer interactivi­
ty and navigation capability, reader-controlled personalization, and other fea­
tures that go beyond what Atlas enables, we now use our own custom-built
single-source publishing system.
Why is it being organized? Publishing print and ebook versions of a text from
the same source files is the only way to produce both in a cost-effective and
maintainable fashion. Approaches that require any “hand-crafting” would make
it impossible to revise the book on a timely schedule. Furthermore, a survey of
Berkeley students in the summer of 2012 revealed a great diversity of preferred
platforms for reading digital books that included laptop computers, Apple and
Android tablets, and seven different dedicated ebook readers. Only an automa­
ted single-source publishing strategy could produce all these outputs.
The highly granular structure for the content resources that comprise this book
makes cross-referencing vastly more precise, making it easier to use the book
as a textbook and job aid. It will also make it easier to maintain and adapt the
text for use in online courses. (The emerging best practice for online courses is
to break up lectures and study content into smaller units than used in tradition­
al classroom lectures.)
How much is it being organized? The nature and extent of resource organization
for this book reflects its purpose of bringing together multiple disciplines that
recognize organizing as a fundamental issue but from different perspectives.
The book contains many specialized topics and domain-specific examples that
might overwhelm the shared concepts. Our solution was to write a lean core
text and to move much of the disciplinary and domain-specific content into tag­
564

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

ged endnotes. These categories of endnotes are somewhat arbitrary, but the au­
thoring task of identifying content to go into endnotes is a non-trivial one.
The extent of resource organization is also affected by the choice of XML vo­
cabulary, and we carefully considered whether to choose DITA or DocBook. DI­
TA has the benefit of having more native support for modular authoring and
transparent customization and updating, but DocBook is much older and hence
has better toolkits. We eventually chose DocBook.658[Com]
When is it being organized? Despite the fact that the lecture notes with which
the book began were in XML, we decided to author the book using Microsoft
Word. Many of the authors had little experience with XML editors, and the high­
ly developed commenting and revision management facilities in Word proved
very useful. This tradeoff imposed the burden of converting files to XML during
the production process, but only two of the authors were still working on the
book at that stage, and both have decades of experience with hypertext markup
languages.
How or by whom is it being organized? The chapter authors used Word style
sheets in a careful manner, tagging text with styles rather than using formatting
overrides. This enabled a conversion vendor to convert most of the book from
Word to XML semi-automatically. Some cleanup of the markup is inevitable be­
cause of the ambiguity created when the source markup with Word styles is less
granular than the target markup in XML. We do not know whether the amount
of work left for us was atypical.
Nevertheless, waiting until the book was substantially finished to convert to
XML meant that we were also deferring the effort to mark up the text with cross
references, citations, glossary terms, and index entries, because these types of
content were not included in the Word authoring templates and style sheets. As
a result, a substantial amount of effort has been required of our copy and mark­
up editor that could have been done by chapter editors if they had authored na­
tively in XML. However, having a single markup editor has given this book a
more consistent and complete bibliography, glossary, and index than would be
have possible with multiple authors.
Other considerations. Because every bit of content in the book is tagged as ei­
ther “core” or discipline-specific, our source files collectively represent a “fami­
ly of books” with 2048 different members, any one of which we can build by fil­
tering the content to include any combination from zero to eleven disciplines. It
is impractical to publish this many editions, but we hope to use this flexibility to
enable instructors to tailor the text for a wide range of courses in many differ­
ent academic disciplines and customize the text for both graduate and under­
graduate students. Better still would be an approach that defers the generation
of a particular version of an ebook from “publishing time” to “reading time.”
The same algorithms apply, but now the reader decides when and how to apply
12.4 Single-Source Textbook Publishing

them, enabling the dynamic configuration of the book's content. This radical ca­
pability is experimental as of August 2015, but we expect it to generally availa­
ble before too long.
This design for a book challenges conventional definitions of book editions and
forces us to imagine new ways to acknowledge collaborative authorship. But
asking “What is The Discipline of Organizing?,” given these new authoring and
publishing models, is a similar question to the one asked in Chapter 4, “What is
Macbeth?”

12.5 Organizing a Kitchen
By Emilie Hardman, April 2013.
Overview. Just about everyone has a kitchen in their home or apartment, and
most kitchens contain many of the same resources. These include pots and
pans, dishes, bowls, drinking glasses, silverware, and cooking tools of various
kinds. Kitchens are also often the location for organizing food items, cooking in­
gredients, spices, wine, and other beverages. Kitchens also invariably contain
refrigerators and freezers for storing prepared and preserved food.
The organizing system for a kitchen is highly influenced by the size, shape, and
arrangement of the counters, cabinets, shelves, and other parts of the physical
environment of the kitchen. A person building a new home might be able to de­
sign this kitchen environment, but most people treat this as a given and work
within its affordances, often because there are limits to how much the physical
environment can be easily changed.
What is being organized? Our wine, wine glasses, cocktail glasses and ingredi­
ents, as well as tea and coffee stuff were stored in the cabinet by the fridge,
close to the center worktable so people could have easy access to them. Be­
cause of space limitations, this meant that our water glasses had to be some­
where else, but as we would usually put out water for dinner parties or have a
pitcher and glasses on a tray when people came over, we thought this was rea­
sonable, since the things people would most often be looking for and need easy
access to for themselves would be these more social drinking glasses.
We also bought a freestanding worktable with a butcher’s block and stainless
steel for pastry and chocolate work, as well as extra counter space in general. It
worked as a prep space and as an area to lay out finished dishes or drinks for
people to serve themselves when we had parties.
Some kitchen tools were kept with the food items to which they applied: for ex­
ample, the coffee and the coffee grinder, or the cutting board, toaster, bread
knife and bread all together. Other tools were kept with like tools: potato peel­
ers, julienne tools, knives, etc. This was probably because of the kind of flexibili­

ty something like a potato peeler would have versus a coffee grinder; it also
made more sense to put lots of these little things together in a drawer rather
than leave them strewn out around the apples or potatoes.
Pots and pans had their own spaces and were stacked within one another; same
with dishes. Most frequently used things were given preference over specialty
tools.
Other things that were organized around the social dimensions of the kitchen
were some food items and serving elements. For example, we used bowls to or­
ganize chocolate bars and treats that might easily be grabbed to set out and
serve. Similarly, we kept stacks of serving bowls easily at hand so we could
empty pretzels or tortilla chips, olives, etc., quickly and casually.
Why is it being organized? We wanted to emphasize a feeling of comfort and
openness in our kitchen, so people would feel free to get what they wanted

12.5 Organizing a Kitchen

567

The Discipline of Organizing

when they needed it. It also had to work on a practical level to be an efficient
work area in a small space, so those concerns had to be balanced as well.
When is it being organized? We ended up moving silverware at one point be­
cause friends would consistently open a particular drawer in our center work is­
land to look for silverware. Initially, I had specialized tools in that drawer be­
cause they were what I would reach for when I was working on something like
making chocolates, but because of the continuous confusion, we moved those
tools to another drawer and put the silverware where people seemed to expect
it.
The fridge and freezer was organized by type of food for orderliness, ease of ac­
cess, and immediacy of knowing when we had. We have a pull-out freezer, so
things could get a little hidden, but assuming no one had compromised the sys­
tem, you would know it was frozen fruit all of the way down in one segment and
flours in another.
Some food items demanded different placement or storage based on their ripe­
ness, the season, etc. In August we might be overrun with tomatoes, for exam­
ple, and the window sills would fill up with them, whereas we would usually put
them in a bowl if there were just a few.
How or by whom is it being organized? I think one thing to sum up would be to
say that my partner is a librarian and I am trained as an archivist. We both care
about classification and public service, so as people who also entertain a lot, I
think these very practical and intuitive systems of grouping things is a motiva­
tion.
My father, an engineer who in his retirement does a lot of woodworking, built
two cabinets that would just fit into the space and provide more storage than
the two upper cabinets and three base cabinets provided in the kitchen.
Other considerations. The whole kitchen was not organized around guests,
though. We also arranged things to be practical for cooking and for space sav­
ing. Food in the cabinets was organized by general function: for example, there
was a shelf of dried beans in jars, another of dried chilies and spices—things
that give flavor. Spices were organized within that by general type in rows and
then alphabetically within those rows. This was because the rows helped group
things which might be likely used together (e.g., cinnamon, cloves, mace, nut­
meg) and alphabetically because so many of them look the same from the out­
side; knowing that the oregano would necessarily be shelved before the thyme
was useful. Beans, though, because they are more immediately identifiable, less
used, and certainly not as often used in concert (as one would with spices), I
was a little more loose with and sometimes just arranged to a general aesthetic
preference; if we had heirloom money beans, I might have preferred to see
them over the standard red lentils, for example.

12.6 Earth Orbiting Satellites
By Daniel Brenners, December 2014.
Overview. Twenty two thousand miles above our heads, a global race for orbital
real estate is underway. A single circular orbit around the Earth, called the geo­
stationary Earth orbit (GEO), is the only area in space that allows a satellite to
remain in a fixed point in the sky above Earth's surface while it rotates.1 This
prime location allows for satellites to have consistent communication with the
ground below. Satellite television, a $100 billion industry, relies on satellites
within the GEO to broadcast signals to homes across the world. Global position­
ing systems (GPS) and military applications also depend on satellites within this
thin ring around the Earth. Unfortunately, space is severely limited in the GEO,
and tension is growing over who gets to send their satellites to this valuable
parking lot in the sky. The principles used to organize which satellites get to be
placed in the GEO have many unforeseen legal and sociopolitical complications.
As room becomes limited, it becomes increasingly important to find a solution to
the problem of multiple organizing agents competing to organize this system to
support varying interactions.
What is being organized? The scope of resources being organized are the satel­
lites being deployed to the GEO. These are physical objects that have been
launched into orbit. The satellites are each unique and are able to provide a va­
riety of interactions. The only unifying attribute that they share is that they are
computers that are able to send and receive radio signals to and from Earth. To
stay in orbit, they are also able to adjust their position with propulsion systems.
This organizing system is designed to manage a collection in which resources
are continually added and removed. The International Telecommunications Un­
ion (ITU) records which portions of the orbit are already occupied.2 Satellites
cannot stay in the orbit forever, as they expend lots of energy performing com­
putational processes and maintaining orbit, and eventually run out of power.
The resources follow a lifecycle that is unique to each individual resource, but
the timescale is typically one to fifteen years.3
Why is it being organized? Satellites are being organized in the GEO to support
several interactions. The GEO allows satellites to move at the same rate as the
Earth, giving it a stationary view of more than 40 percent of the Earth's surface.
Such a view is ideal for broadcasting signals to large regions and performing re­
mote sensing, such as weather forecasting. They also serve as crucial relay
points to transfer telecommunications across the globe. Other interactions that
these satellites provide include surveillance, scientific research, global position­
ing, navigation, and military reconnaissance.3 Longitudinal positioning along the
GEO shapes which interactions can occur and which users can interact with the

12.6 Earth Orbiting Satellites

569

The Discipline of Organizing

satellite. For instance, a satellite directly over the Atlantic Ocean may not be
well suited to broadcast a television signal, but may be positioned to relay sig­
nals from North America to Europe.
The users are practically everyone on Earth. Civilians use geostationary satel­
lites directly when they use GPS or need to have a call relayed to distant re­
gions of the world. Commercial organizations, such as television providers, use
these satellites to broadcast signals down to viewers. Geostationary satellites
are also particularly useful for early warning systems used by the military to de­
tect ballistic events around the globe.
How much is it being organized? If resources are able to be placed in the GEO,
they are placed in a vacant slot that the applicant chooses, based on what types
of interactions they want to support and what users they want interacting with
the satellite. To prevent signal interference and collision, satellites need to be
placed very far apart, leaving only 2,000 total orbital slots where satellites can
be placed in the GEO.4 The ITU uses a first-come, first-served organizing princi­
ple to decide which resources are placed into orbital slots, provided the appli­
cant completes the lengthy application process.
The organization applying for the slot chooses where to place its satellite. The
ITU catalogs these slots as degrees longitude, and includes other resource de­
scriptions such as the name of the satellite, country of operator, types of users,
mass, expected lifetime, and contractor.3 Organizations choose to place satel­
lites around the longitude of the Earth that the satellite is supposed to interact
with. Since the latitude is fixed at zero degrees, countries with the same longi­
tude but different latitudes (countries directly north or south of each other)
must vie for the same slots.
When is it being organized? Satellites are added as soon as they can be ap­
proved by the ITU and launched into orbit. At the end of their life cycle, the Fed­
eral Communications Commission mandates that U.S. satellites are pushed into
what is called the graveyard orbit, which is a few hundred kilometers outside of
the GEO.5 At this point, another satellite can be added to the vacant slot via the
ITU application process.
How or by whom is it being organized? Many organizing agents are competing
with each other to organize this system according to their own needs. Applica­
tions to occupy the GEO come from countries, scientific organizations, compa­
nies, and civilians. Satellite TV companies such as DirecTV, Dish Network, and
Intelsat own a large number of the slots across the western hemisphere. Coun­
tries such as the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom own a majority
of the military satellites, and multinational European organizations own a large
share of orbital slots as well.3

570

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Other considerations. Although the ITU serves as an authoritative entity for this
organizing system, the reality is that the ambiguous legality of ownership in out­
er space means that anyone can attempt to organize this system. The ITU is in
place to perform the useful task of cataloging occupied slots and facilitating the
filling of vacancies, but it has no way of enforcing these guidelines.
This organizing system is interesting because many agents are attempting to or­
ganize the same system. There are also interesting social implications that stem
from the system’s principles of organization. The first-come, first-served system
of the ITU has the effect of allowing only technologically advanced organiza­
tions to manage the collection. It does not take into consideration that by the
time many countries are finally ready to use this type of technology, there will
be no more room in the GEO belt.
Ironically, the only legal claim to sovereignty that has been made of this organ­
izing system has been from countries that, generally, have no means of organiz­
ing it themselves. In 1976 eight equatorial countries, which lie directly below
the GEO belt, stated that they had exclusive rights over these slots in a docu­
ment known as the Bogotá Declaration.6 The tenuous claim was that the orbit is
not a part of outer space, because its existence is solely dependent on Earth's
gravity, and that the earth within the borders of the equatorial countries creates
GEO with its gravitational pull. Many experts disagree, stating that the gravita­
tional pull from the moon and other celestial bodies defines the GEO, and state
that the orbit does indeed lie in outer space because it is further than 100 kilo­
meters from Earth. This demarcation, known as the Kármán line, is a widely ac­
cepted definition of when space begins.7 This would then make the GEO fall
within the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, effectively leaving no possibility for owner­
ship of the orbit.
Finding a dividing line between space and Earth’s atmosphere is an interesting
topic, especially considering that ownership of valuable resources may be deci­
ded based on what is included in the category of space versus the category of
atmosphere. In this case, the Kármán line roughly represents the altitude at
which an aircraft would have to propel itself faster than the speed at which the
Earth rotates to establish enough lift to keep itself up. While this is not intuitive
(hardly carving nature at its joints), it does serve as a useful demarcation that is
not completely arbitrary. It can be seen as a goal-based category, where the goal
is using traditional means of traveling through the air using aeronautics. It
makes sense that this is the line the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale
uses to divide astronautics and aeronautics.
The limited availability of spots in the GEO, along with the relatively small num­
ber of countries able to launch satellites, has the potential to further divide
countries. By the time most countries will be able to launch satellites, there will
likely not be any room left. Although there are only around 400 satellites cur­

12.6 Earth Orbiting Satellites

571

The Discipline of Organizing

rently in geostationary orbit, there are already more filings for ITU applications
than there are spots available.4 Only a select few countries will be able to take
advantage of the GEO, leaving others to depend on these countries for commu­
nication, scientific research, and surveillance. Furthermore, this could limit the
interactions of these less developed countries to those interactions dictated by
the countries with geostationary satellites. In particular, these developed coun­
tries can greatly influence the information that citizens in other countries can
receive via satellite.
But even within the technologically advanced countries, competition for orbital
slots may be heating up. In early 2014, the US unveiled its Geosynchronous
Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP), which aims to create maneuver­
able satellites that monitor and protect the precious GEO belt.8 This reveal
comes only months after China was seen practicing its anti-satellite missile ca­
pabilities.9 In Russia, $300 million is being spent to construct a craft that would
act as a “space broom” to push satellites out of geostationary orbit. The US has
a similar program, named the Phoenix project under DARPA, developing a ro­
botic device that can help maintain satellites and possibly dismantle others
without causing excess space debris.
Although this might simply be countries attempting to flex their military mus­
cles, these technologies represent a newfound ability for countries to organize
resources in the GEO to fit their own agenda. Years ago, the countries that were
able to get satellites into orbit were the ones that could reap the benefits. Now,
it seems that we may be entering an age where a country’s ability to make room
for itself, possibly by force, will determine if it can make use of precious interac­
tions created by these limited resources.

12.7 CalBug and its Search Interface Redesign
By Gracen Brilmyer, December 2014.
Overview. The CalBug project, housed out of the The Essig Museum of Entomol­
ogy at the University of California, Berkeley, is a collaborative initiative between
nine California institutions with a goal to digitize over a million specimens. Digi­
tization involves imaging both specimens and their labels as well as storing
their collection info in a database. The CalBug project also is attempting to
georeference, or locate the original latitude and longitude coordinates, for these
million specimens (some dating back to the 18th century) so that they can be
better used for research. The project uses many student workers, graduate stu­
dents, and volunteers to capture the images and data. Over the past few years,
it has participated in the Notes from Nature project, which helps connect citi­
zen scientists to scientific research. Through the images generated of the speci­
men labels by the team at the Essig Museum, citizen scientists digitally tran­
scribe the data that can be read from the image. The Essig, after each label is
transcribed by 24 citizen scientists, runs an R program to find the most accu­
rate transcription and transfer it into the Essig’s database. These combined ef­
forts have accumulated in over 209,000 specimen records and over 400,000 im­
ages and counting. This project has a large scope and an ever-increasing scale.
What is being organized? The insect specimens in the CalBug project are digi­
tized on an individual level, with unique identifying numbers, and new specimen
records and their associated data are continually being added to the digital col­
lection. Both the specimens and their data are being organized. Existing groups
of specimens are prioritized for digitization and new physical specimens are ac­
cessioned into the collection and are databased upon arrival.
Why is it being organized? An individual specimen’s associated data can be
highly variable; however, as long as a specimen has the time and place of its col­
lection (no matter how vague) associated with it, it is valuable research materi­
al. The physical specimens are organized to facilitate the collection manager’s

12.7 CalBug and its Search Interface Redesign

573

The Discipline of Organizing

use of the collection. When physical specimens need to be borrowed, they must
be efficiently found, packaged, and sent out on loan, so fastidious organization
is key when locating thousands of specimens. The digital organization of the col­
lection also facilitates the duties of museum staff and the collection manager by
allowing for expanded interaction with the collection by using the database. The
digital collection’s web interface, undergoing a redesign as of the time of this
writing, makes the collection accessible for researchers and novices alike, as
well as to foster data sharing to other data repositories. Since the specimen da­
ta follows digital curatorial standards, a web interface that allows these fields to
be easily searchable and navigable can add to the use of the collection for a
broader audience, which is a major impetus for the redesign.

Informatics Edition

How much is it being organized? As discussed in the previous section, the speci­
mens and their information are subject to multiple levels of organization, and
each level of organization supports a different type of user. The data of the Cal­
Bug Project is organized according to Darwin Core (DwC), a standard “designed
to facilitate the exchange of information about the geographic occurrence of
species and the existence of specimens in collections.”1 Certain specimen attrib­
utes have concrete institutional parameters, such as unique identifying numbers
and taxonomic identification, while others have less strict parameters (e.g. a
precise location of where a specimen is found), although they still must use spe­
cific DwC fields. Although there are institutional taxonomies in place for infor­
mation associated with a specimen’s collection and identification, the CalBug
search interface design in Figure 12.1, CalBug search interface allows for an
outward-facing reorganization of the existing fields.
When is it being organized, and by whom? The categorization and organization
happens at multiple times for one specimen. If identified, the specimen is al­
ready inserted into the taxonomic classification scheme—the hierarchy of how
species are related. This scientific warrant is inherited and replicated in the
physical curation of the collection, and specimens are further sorted (within a
taxon) by geographic region. Aligning with taxonomic categories provides a
clear hierarchy for sorting and locating physical specimens and, with changes in
taxonomy having to be published, makes collection maintenance fairly consis­
tent.
The specimens are organized a second time when they are databased, either by
interns or through Notes from Nature. The data is stored in a MySQL database
that uses mostly DwC fields, an institutional taxonomy for specimen data. The
digitization of specimens, through utilizing DwC institutional semantics, makes
collection maintenance, governance, and interaction easier, as the collection
manager can search in a multifaceted manner, better understand the holdings
of the museum, and track specimens for loans. The unique specimen numbers
allow for individual tracking, and the other DwC fields provide multiple areas
for accurate search and retrieval.
For the CalBug web search interface, the specimens retain their classification
hierarchy within the database. However, the outward-facing search fields aim to
serve a broader audience, not just the collection manager and museum staff.
Thus the search application organizes the resources a third time “on the way
out” of the database in response to a user query. As this design is optimized for
researchers and students, the classification appears to focus more on taskono­
my instead of the institutional taxonomy (see Figure 12.1, CalBug search inter­
face). The 20 search fields provided in the search interface, while actually
searching through the ~100 fields in the database, facilitate precise information
retrieval. Although fewer search fields might yield lower accuracy, user testing

12.7 CalBug and its Search Interface Redesign

has shown that the new search design improves accuracy by not requiring users
to know exactly which DwC field to query.

Figure 12.2. Crosswalk table

This crosswalk table maps the fields in the CalBug search interface to the under­
lying database columns.

The search is further expanded by having a ‘Search any field’ box, which literal­
ly looks in every DwC field for a term, as well as a “Common Name” field, to
support novice searches, such as “beetle” and “butterfly” instead of “coleop­
tera” and “lepidoptera.” The intrinsic properties of the specimens lend the re­
sults to simple (alphabetic and numeric) sorting as well as filtering (through the
“Refine” option) on the list view of the results pages. Additional views of results,
including a map view showing collection locations and a grid view that displays
specimen photos, help users locate desired specimens and reorganize as needed
to suit their needs.

12.8 Weekly Newspaper
By Ian MacFarland, December 2013.
Overview. A weekly neighborhood newspaper in New York City now covers the
entire borough of Queens. Rather than publish a single weekly edition for this
highly diverse area of more than 2 million people, its owners have opted to pro­
duce 14 separate editions, each centered on a different neighborhood. All edi­
tions share a deadline, delivery schedule, and staff pool, but each has unique
content tailored to its target readers.
What is being organized? The newspaper’s resources—its content—consist
mainly of articles and photos generated by staff and freelance contributors
throughout the week. Often, newspapers will assign their reporters to beats
based on subject matter (politics, education, “cops and courts,” etc.), making
them domain experts who cover stories on that beat throughout a wide geo­
graphical area. However, because of this paper’s historical orientation toward
“hyper-local” neighborhood news, it has given each of its seven full-time report­
ers a more granular geographical beat that corresponds to two of the 14 edi­
tions’ coverage areas, within which they are responsible for general assignment
reporting. Most reporters also have a specialty for covering news that is of more
general interest throughout the borough, such as citywide government or trans­
portation issues, and they will include coverage of these domains in their story
budgets for the week as well. The staff maintains a centralized story list that in­
cludes a handful of resource descriptions for each story: its slug (an abbrevi­
ated, descriptive name, including tags for its relevant neighborhoods), its
length, and whether it has “art.”
Why is it being organized? The media market in New York is crowded and ex­
tremely competitive, and this newspaper believes its competitive edge lies in its
laser-focus on individual neighborhoods. Furthermore, most of its readers are
subscribers who receive the paper in the mail, not newsstand buyers. As a re­
sult, the paper generally eschews the familiar tabloid approach of splashing the
most salacious story of the week across the front page and usually fronts two
stories that are “small-bore” but extremely relevant to the neighborhood, such
as the doings of local school or government officials, notable crimes, or humaninterest stories featuring neighborhood residents. The deeper into the paper
one goes, the less local its content becomes, and stories often appear in more
than one edition, in different locations and even with different headlines, to tai­
lor them to an appropriate level of localization.
On a more general level, of course, the paper must support the conventional in­
teractions all readers expect from newspapers. Readers are rarely expected to
progress through the paper from front to back, so it supports a wide variety of

12.8 Weekly Newspaper

577

The Discipline of Organizing

reading styles; large headlines and photos and concise, compelling story “ledes”
(opening paragraphs) facilitate skimming and scanning interactions, and divid­
ing the paper into sections, such as “Opinion,” “Sports,” and “Arts & Entertain­
ment,” lets readers skip directly to their areas of interest after turning past
page one.
How much is it being organized? The level of organization behind the scenes at
this small, local newspaper is surprisingly complex. The primary organizing
principle that determines a story’s placement is its relevance, which is a func­
tion of location granularity (does it directly affect the people of this neighbor­
hood? Did it happen here?), significance (will readers find it important?), and
time (is it old news? Has anyone else reported it yet?). Counterbalancing that is
the economic reality of the struggling newspaper industry, which results in of­
ten severely limited space for the news (because paper and press time are cost­
ly physical constraints) and manpower with which to produce all 14 editions be­
fore deadline. The result is a hierarchical system in which the 14 editions are
categorized into three zones; in each zone, about two-thirds of the pages are
common to all editions, and the remaining third (including, most crucially, pages
one through three) are unique to each single edition. Thus, for instance, a
general-interest story about transportation need not be laid out 14 separate
times, but one about a fatal car accident can appear on page one for the neigh­
borhoods where it occurred and where the victims were from, and further back
(or not at all) for other neighborhoods.
When is it being organized? In a weekly news cycle, selection, creation, and or­
ganizing of editorial resources is largely concurrent. The story list is updated on
a rolling basis throughout the week, and an article or photo’s placement in the
paper is often planned based on its intended subject matter well in advance of
when the resource is actually created. However, organizing must be completed
long before it reaches its intended users, because the final layouts must be prin­
ted, collated, and mailed to readers, which, due to logistical concerns, takes
several days—so the paper is laid out on Tuesday (as late as possible to maxi­
mize the window for ad sales), printed on Wednesday, and delivered by the Post­
al Service on Thursday or Friday.
How or by whom is it being organized? Human agents—specifically, editors—are
the newspaper’s primary organizers. They rely heavily on the judgment of the
reporters, who are most familiar with their beats, to determine a story’s rele­
vance and placement for each edition, as well as their own news judgment, as­
sessment of the story’s quality, and estimation of where the story will physically
fit based on ad placements (which are decided first). The implementation of
their organizing system is carried out by page layout designers, with some soft­
ware automation on the part of the paper’s content management system.

578

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

Other considerations. Part of the grind of a weekly news cycle is that the effec­
tivity of the paper’s resources is never guaranteed; when the next edition comes
out, they all become yesterday’s news, and one never knows when new develop­
ments will render a story irrelevant or incorrect; in fact, because of the latency
between layout and delivery, a story’s effectivity may even expire before its pub­
lication.

12.9 The CODIS DNA Database
By Becca Stanger, December 2013.
Overview. Operating on a local, state, and federal level, the Combined DNA In­
dex System (CODIS) is the FBI DNA database. As of October 2013, the National
DNA Index (NDIS), or the federal level of the CODIS, contained over 10,647,800
offender profiles, 1,677,100 arrestee profiles, and 522,200 forensic profiles. De­
signed to help solve crimes, this database has generated over 255,400 hits and
has aided over 216,200 investigations. While this organizing system has played
a crucial role in reducing crime by enabling more interactions in the law en­
forcement agency than ever before, it provokes numerous ethical questions
worth exploring.
What is being organized? The CODIS database maintains digital records or
“DNA profiles” for a wide range of people involved in criminal justice cases, in­
cluding convicted offenders, arrestees, missing persons, and more. Specifically,
these profiles are measurements of one or two alleles of 13 predetermined
unique genetic sequence loci. These precise measurements provide enough
granularity for the profiles to uniquely identify a single individual.
These resource descriptions are generated, often with polymerase chain reac­
tion technology, from the original DNA specimen resources by accredited labo­
ratories nationwide. Upon creation, the resources themselves—the specimens—
are kept at the laboratories, while the resource descriptions—the digital profiles
—are added to the CODIS database. No offender personal identifiers are as­
signed to the profiles; however, information on the submitting agency, speci­
men, and personnel is stored with the profile.
Rather than focusing on collecting resource descriptions, the FBI could have
chosen to collect the original resources themselves. Presumably, though, this
level of coordination of physical resources (e.g., shipping, storage, maintenance,
etc.) would have placed an additional cost on the federal government and re­
quired legislative approval. Thus, it is understandable that the FBI would
choose to minimize cost and effort by focusing on the resource descriptions
alone.
Why is it being organized? In the past, law enforcement agencies were limited
to solving crimes within their geographic region. A detective working on a mur­
12.9 The CODIS DNA Database

579

The Discipline of Organizing

der in California, for example, may never have heard of a related murder in
New York. The CODIS database organizing system encourages that coordination
between law enforcement agencies in an effort to solve crimes.
With 10,647,800 offender profiles in the NDIS alone, though, the massive CO­
DIS database required an organizing system in order to prove useful to the law
enforcement agencies involved. The successful creation and maintenance of this
organizing system has offered newfound interactions to a wide variety of gov­
ernment officials. In addition to law enforcement agencies, judicial courts, crim­
inal defense agencies, and population statistics agencies can access the CODIS
organizing system, enabling them to perform a wide variety of functions, includ­
ing identifying potential suspects in criminal investigations, identifying missing
persons, collecting population statistics, and exonerating convicted criminals.
How much is it being organized? As mentioned previously, the high degree of re­
source description granularity in measuring 13 specific genetic sequence loci
enables DNA profiles to uniquely identify each individual in the database. That
being said, the DNA profiles are not simply heaped into one massive database.
Instead, the databases are maintained on both a state and federal level. A new
profile might be checked against a smaller state database as well as the larger
national one. In addition, the databases are divided into different indices de­
pendent on the DNA source, including an offender index, arrestee index, foren­
sic index, and missing persons index.
This division of the database into separate indices poses a tradeoff dilemma,
though. If CODIS did not subdivide the database into federal, state and source
indices, it is possible the algorithm would be able to find more obscure hits,
since the search parameters would be broadened. This increase in hit frequency
might result in more investigations aided.
The tradeoff, however, is that the broadened search parameters would also ne­
cessitate a more complex search algorithm and a longer search process. This
delay would most likely lead to fewer hits overall. Thus, in government institu­
tions where time and resources are limited, it is more important for the CODIS
organizing system users to generate a larger number of hits with subdivided da­
tabases than more accurate hits in one collective database. Categories in the
CODIS organizing system help simplify the interaction processes.
When is it being organized? DNA profiles enter the CODIS organizing system
when participating, accredited local, state, and federal laboratories submit
them. Thus, the laboratory technicians handling the resource and resource de­
scription decide on a case-by-case basis how a given profile should be catego­
rized and which indices it should be added to and checked against.

580

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

That being said, the lab technicians are given strict standards on how a given
DNA profile should be categorized. These standards vary state by state depend­
ing on state law.
How or by whom is it being organized? Beyond laboratory and state involvement
in CODIS, the FBI ultimately maintains and oversees the CODIS database. It
maintains the software and search algorithms, performs searches throughout
the system, and oversees strict quality assurance standards for all participating
laboratories.
To avoid the risk of bias or error amongst lab technicians, the FBI could poten­
tially choose to instead perform the laboratory processing and categorization
themselves. This alteration, however, would present new challenges, such as
new federal costs related to maintaining and processing the resources men­
tioned previously. In addition, pulling together all resources into a FBI process­
ing center would necessitate a meticulous record of the resource’s originating
state to ensure resource descriptions are categorized in accordance with state
laws. The FBI’s strict maintenance of standards and laws is the best option for
addressing the risk of error and bias.
Other considerations. The CODIS organizing system presents a wide range of
intriguing ethical questions surrounding race, gender, criminal justice, and pri­
vacy. Perhaps the most hotly debated issue surrounding DNA databases arose
when the private DNA testing company 23andMe announced that it would dis­
continue the sale of its genetic tests in response to FDA demands, prompting
more media questions than ever before on the maintenance and use of DNA da­
tabases.
Likewise, many have questioned the legitimacy of the CODIS maintenance of
DNA profiles. The ACLU, for example, has noted the possibility of “function
creep” in the maintenance of a government DNA database which could lead our
country down a slippery slope towards a “brave new world” where private ge­
netic information could be collected and used in abusive, discriminating man­
ners.
With the commercial surveillance of 23andMe and government surveillance by
the NSA at the forefront of media attention, it is possible we will see more at­
tention turned to the legitimacy of the maintenance of the CODIS organizing
system in the coming years.

12.10 Honolulu Rail Transit
By Carlo Liquido, December 2015
Overview. The Honolulu Rail Transit Project is an urban rail rapid transit system
under construction in Honolulu on the island of O’ahu, Hawaii. Honolulu’s noto­
riously bad traffic has plagued locals and tourists for decades, and for almost as
long, proposals to address the traffic problems and pay for the solution have
been very contentious and political. Construction began in 2011 and is expected
to finish in 2019, but delays have been frequent.
What resources are being used? The new railway transit system under construc­
tion in O’ahu will run along the southwest region of the island spanning a total
of 20 miles, from East Kapolei to Downtown Honolulu with a total of 21 stops
strategically placed throughout. There are a number of ways in which one could
scope this project. What are the cultural and political limitations? What are the
environmental effects and resources that will be indirectly affected? What are
the topographic constraints of a railway system in Hawaii? In terms of the scope
of my analysis, however, the people—namely the things the organizing system is
intended for—are the primary resources. The principle guiding the organizing
system is to reduce traffic and make the traveling experience more efficient as a
whole.

O'ahu Traffic

gested, especially in and

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Why are the resources organized? The guid­
ing principle behind the organizing system of
a rail transit system is to reduce traffic and
make commuting more efficient. According to
the Department of Business, Economic Devel­
opment and Tourism, the amount of traffic on
almost every major highway on O’ahu has in­
creased from 2012-2014. Moreover, the
dearth of job creation on other parts of the is­
land, namely the west side, has focused traffic
into and out of downtown Honolulu, as shown
in the first map.
This skewed traffic pattern, limited real es­
tate, and inflexible road infrastructure has ne­
cessitated an above-ground railway system
linking the west side of O’ahu with the bur­
geoning downtown area of Honolulu. This
new organizing system seeks to rebalance the
traffic system by reorganizing its resources,
that is, by taking drivers and bus commuters

Informatics Edition

off the road and onto the rail. O’ahu has only three major freeways, the H1, H2,
and H3. The freeway H2 bottlenecks from the west into H1. Drivers and bus
commuters are organized in such a way that peak hours of traffic are unavoida­
ble. The new transit will conceivably provide an additional layer of organization
to the currently
How much are the resources organized? There are 21 planned stations that run
along the 20-mile span of track. The train stations are arranged to serve as
many people as possible by concentrating them in the most densely populated
areas.

Population Density

Darker areas represent high-density
tracts while lighter areas represent
low-density tracts. The denselypopulated stretch from Keahi Lagoon
to Honolulu Downtown, also has the
highest density of traffic. It makes
sense that this portion of the rail sys­
tem constitutes almost half the num­
ber of total stops in just a quarter of
the total mileage.

Income per household also plays a vi­
tal role in how these stops were selec­
ted. The rail transit system predomi­
nately runs along areas of low-income
(Hawaii Dep. of Economic Develop­
ment and Tourism. CC-BY-2.0.)
neighborhoods (tan and brown indi­
cates low income per household,
while green indicates high income per household). This design principle embod­
ies an assumption that people with lower incomes are more likely to rely on
public transit.
Population in Honolulu area is highly
concentrated in lowland areas.

When are the resources organized? As with any construction project of this
magnitude, the organizing system was planned in detail before construction—
down to the number of pillars, the amount of concrete, the imported steel for
rail cars, etc. However, after construction excavation revealed ancient burial
sites, the Native Hawaiian community demanded many changes to the project.
The number of stops has remained the same but the route has changed dramati­
cally.
How or by whom is it being organized? There are a number of interested parties
with varying degrees of power. At the forefront, the government—that is, the
State of Hawaii—makes the final decision. However, the people of Hawaii direct­
ly influence their decisions.

Honolulu Area Income per
Household

Household income is lowest in the
most densely populated areas.

The protection of cultural resources,
practices, and beliefs is important in
Hawaii, both as a matter of law and of
culture. Private archeology firms,
state officials, and cultural descend­
ants work together to reduce and mit­
igate impacts to archaeologically sig­
nificant properties. The Oahu Island
Burial Council, for instance, is a state
council created to help protect iwi ku­
puna (ancestral bones). It stresses the
importance of consulting recognized
lineal descendants before any excava­
tion for the rail project is carried out.

Where is it being organized? The
“where” component of the organizing
system is not as important for the
scope of this analysis as other design
questions. However, the physical nature of the project highly constrains how the
system can be organized. The volcanic origin of O’ahu, does not allow for a
below-ground rail system. The limited real estate, similarly, does not allow for a
ground-level system. The sharp and steep volcanic ridges that cut across the is­
land are barriers that limit where the rail system might go.

12.11 The Antikythera Mechanism
By Murray Maloney, 2 March 2014.
Overview. In 1900, a strange looking mechanical device was recovered from a
shipwreck off of the island of Antikythera, Greece. Only in the 1970s was it de­
termined that the device was an ancient mechanical computer that performed
astronomical calculations; it had a manual crank control with a rate of one turn
per day, forward or backward in time; its user interface presented calendrical,
solar, lunar, and planetary positions.1
The Antikythera Mechanism persists through time as a collection of artifacts
and a model of intellectual achievement. Thought to have been constructed by
Archimedes at Syracuse or by Posidonius at Rhodes, the mechanism was recov­
ered from a ship wreck near the Greek island of Antikythera in 1900-1. The sig­
nificance of the find only began to become apparent in the 1970s when re­
searchers applied modern scanning technology.2

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

What is being organized? The Antiky­
thera Mechanism was an arrangement
of resource descriptions that represen­
ted a classical Alexandrian sol-lunar
calendar, complete with an almanac of
the positions of the sun, moon, known
planets, and specific stars over time.
The resource descriptions are repre­
sented simply by the measurements of
the gears, and the corresponding infor­
mation that is displayed on the front
and rear panels, based on the position
of those gears. These resource descrip­
tions accounted for the range of known
astronomical phenomena at the time.3
The organization of the mechanism
consists of a main solar gear connected
to a hand crank and a collection of gear
trains that ultimately control the rota­
tion of pointers indicating the calendar,
lunar position and phases, the position
of the sun and of all the known planets,
and the nearest eclipse. The mecha­
nism was housed in a wood frame box
with bronze panels whose physicality
was obviously intrinsic to the use of the
device; the panels the back door was
inscribed with what seems to be a us­
er’s guide.

The Antikythera Mechanism calculated the position of the moon by employing
five gear trains to take into account the Saros, Metonic, Callipic, and Exeligmos
cycles. Thus, it was able to predict the dates of solar and lunar eclipses.
Today, the Antikythera is a collection of the eighty-two fragments that have been
recovered from the ship wreck and sea bed, twenty three of which are evidently
inscribed. The fragments have been dated to about 70 BCE based on the coinci­
dent presence of some coins from Pergamum and Ephesus that were recovered
in the 1970s.

12.11 The Antikythera Mechanism

The Discipline of Organizing

Why is it being organized? From a purely pragmatic perspective, the Antiky­
thera Mechanism was a relatively portable computational device. that would
have been used to accurately reckon a very specific calendar system, and to
predict the cycles of days, months, years, and saro, as well as lunations, eclip­
ses, and Olympic games. It would be an invaluable tool for astronomers, mathe­
maticians, civil engineers, and cartographers of the time.
From a philosophical perspective, the Antikythera Mechanism was built to
prove that it could be done. It represents a fulfillment of Aristotelian thought.
Through the ages, the lure of scientific answers to the mathematical riddles pre­
sented among the patterns in the heavens has challenged our burgeoning intel­
lects. The Antikythera Mechanism realized then-modern thinking on mathemat­
ics, engineering, astronomy and calendrical calculation in a portable mechanical
computational device.4
How much is it being organized? Some of the major fragments are on display at
the National Archaeological Museum of Athens; the others are stored.
The Antikythera Mechanism is reported to have had
about thirty gears within a frame whose size was less
than the volume of a large book. The level of miniatur­
ization and the precision of fabrication was not there­
after seen until the next millennium. The engineering
and machining would have required trial models, ac­
curate plans, and custom tooling. There have been
various modern attempts to re-create the Antikythera
Mechanism, or at least to re-create the model it
seems to have manifested.5
When is it being organized? The person who operates
the mechanism turns a hand-operated crank to estab­
lish a date, or contra-wise confirms the current date
by taking sightings and comparing with the dial set­
tings. The front face offers a solar-lunar calendar dial,
a tropical zodiac dial, and an almanac dial with rising
and setting times of various stars. The rear panel of­
fers dials representing the five lunar cycles.

The organization of the engineering data required to build, operate, and main­
tain the Antikythera Mechanism is staggering to imagine, yet it pales in compar­
ison to the organization required to collect and archive astronomical sightings
on clay tablets for hundreds of years.6 (See the sidebar, A Cuneiform Document

In 343 BCE, Aristotle was head of the Macedonian Academy, where he tu­

er's conquest of Babylon in 331 BCE, he ordered Kallisthenes to organize
the translation of all historical astronomical observations, initiating the
transfer of the world's greatest collection of astronomical observations, dat­
ing back to 747 BCE. Within a year, Callippus had developed a new calendar,
designating the summer solstice of 330 BCE as an epoch for astronomers
and calendrical calculation. The Callipic cycle of 76 years less a day, equates
to 27,759 days, and 940 lunations, is represented in the gearing of the

12.12 Autonomous Cars
By Jason Danker, December 2015.
Overview. Automation in cars is nothing new. Automatic transmissions and
cruise control have been around since 1939 and 1958 respectively, but these
systems serve to aid, rather than replace, human drivers. What is new is a near
future potential for fully autonomous cars, cars that are capable of full opera­
tion without an attending human driver.
While other vehicles, such as light rail and monorail trains, have been capable
of fully automatic operation since 1967, these vehicles have the luxury of oper­
ating in closed environments and only need to be able to respond to a defined
set of inputs. Autonomous cars do not have this luxury. In operating “in the
wild,” the systems guiding these cars may be forced to respond to any number
of unanticipated situations. As the automation system cannot enumerate all pos­
sible situations, it must instead rely on continuous organization of its operating
environment.
This is clearly a technical challenge, but it also raises ethical and legal issues.
As autonomous cars act based on the organization of sensory inputs, the organ­
izing systems are necessarily developed relative to ethical considerations,
whether intentional or not. At the most basic level, the organizing system will
direct the autonomous car in making decisions analogous to those posited in the
trolley problem, a famous thought experiment in ethics that forces a choice be­

tween saving five endangered people or taking the life of an innocent person
who had not been in danger. Beyond ethics, autonomous cars also raise legal
questions: if an autonomous car crashes, who is liable for the damages?
What is being organized? An autonomous car will organize information about
the car itself, the objects in its vicinity, and environmental conditions. The car
must keep track of its movements, those of other objects, and the relative posi­
tions of itself and the other objects. It must organize this information within the
environmental framework of lane markings, speed limits, road signs, traffic sig­
nals, weather and traffic conditions, and numerous other constraints. As autono­
mous cars become common, the cars will likely communicate with one another
and this information will also need to be brought into the organizing system.
The car will also need to organize, and likely prioritize, inputs from human oc­
cupants. Regardless of the exact implementation, the organizing system will
necessarily limit what is worthy of organization: it is likely not possible, or desir­
able, to keep track of every insect in the vicinity of the car.
Why is it being organized? The car organizes its surroundings in order to safely
navigate to a destination. While this is the primary interaction enabled by the
organization, countless other interactions support this primary interaction. The
supporting interactions fall into the two categories of prediction and reaction.
The systems being developed by Google use the information that has been or­
ganized to predict what is most likely to happen next: “It predicts that the cy­
clist will ride by and the pedestrian will cross the street.” The systems that have
been launched by Tesla tend to be more reactionary: “Side Collision Warning
further enhances Model S’s active safety capabilities by sensing range and
alerting drivers to objects, such as cars, that are too close to the side of Model
S.”
How much is it being organized? The extent of organization varies based on the
implementation. While Google uses on-board sensors and extremely detailed
street maps to implement self-driving functionality, Tesla’s Autopilot relies onboard sensors and standard GPS data. While the exact extent of the organiza­
tion is not publicly available information, Google has publicly stated “the system
is engineered to work hardest to avoid vulnerable road users (think pedestrians
and cyclists), then other vehicles on the road, and lastly avoid things that don’t
move.” Given this, Google’s categories, and their hierarchy, appear to be de­
fined by their vulnerability.
When is it being organized? For information gathered by on-board sensors, or­
ganization takes place as objects enter and leave the vicinity of the autonomous
car. The organization is ongoing as the car’s surrounding and environment are
constantly changing. In addition to the sensor data, autonomous cars also rely
on map data which is organized in advance. Google’s cars rely on specialized,
highly detailed maps that are being developed as part of the self-driving car

590

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

project and, as such, are unable to drive on roads that have not yet been map­
ped to the necessary level of detail. While Tesla’s Autopilot also relies on maps,
it uses standard GPS maps and is not similarly restricted.
How or by whom is it being organized? The car’s computational processes are
responsible for the organization. That said, the car is restricted to organizing
within the organizing system implemented by the manufacturer. While Google
and Tesla are two of the main companies in this space, many traditional automo­
tive companies are also developing autonomous systems.
Where is it being organized? Except for map data, the organization takes place
within the car’s onboard systems. The organization must take place in the car
itself due to the potential catastrophic consequences of a lag in information
flow. Additionally, ensuring all organization takes place within the car provides
greater security: a self-contained car is less susceptible to attack than a net­
work dependent one.
Other considerations. While it is likely that fully autonomous cars will be tech­
nologically feasible within a few years, the cars may still require human interac­
tions for legal reasons. This is clearly seen in Tesla’s press release for Autopilot:
“The driver is still responsible for, and ultimately in control of, the car.” This
human-in-the-loop design principle creates a legal buffer for autonomous car
manufacturers by treating the “driver” as a “liability sponge” or “moral crumple
zone.” As articulated by Madeleine Elish and Tim Hwang, “the human in an au­
tonomous system may become simply a component—accidentally or intentional­
ly—that is intended to bear the brunt of the moral and legal penalties when the
overall system fails.”
While these issues will ultimately play out through a combination of court rul­
ings and policy decisions, it is interesting to note that there is legal precedent
that could either blame, or exonerate, the “driver” of an autonomous car. Draw­
ing parallels to aviation automation, precedent suggests that the human “driv­
er” will be held responsible for liability claims arising from the operation of the
car. On the other hand, product liability law offers recourse for consumers when
a company’s products fail. Many people have argued that this existing legal
framework is sufficient to handle the liability issues brought up by autonomous
vehicles.
Regardless of the legal complexities that will arise from specific incidents, au­
tonomous cars have great potential to reduce car crashes and improve overall
road safety. The promise of the autonomous technology, even for partially auton­
omous systems, is so great that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administra­
tion is proposing updates to its safety ratings that will penalize manufacturers
that don’t include autonomous technologies in their vehicles.

12.13 IP Addressing in the Global Internet
By Andrew McConachie, December 2013.
Overview. Most people take for granted that the Internet just works. They con­
nect their computer to the Internet, it gets an IP address, and they are able to
communicate with a computer with a different IP address on the other side of
the planet. How did their computer get the correct IP address? How does any
computer or router get the correct IP address? How did the routers and other
computers on the Internet get their IP addresses? Who decides which comput­
ers and which routers get which IP addresses?
What is being organized? At their simplest, an IPv4 address is a 32-bit series of
0′s and 1′s. They are resources that are born-digital, as they have no canonical
physical representation. Their digital canonical representation, with which we
have all become familiar, is called the “dotted quad” format and is 4 numbers
between 0-255 separated with dots. For example, 169.229.216.200 is the IPv4
address for www.berkeley.edu.
Not all IP addresses are of equivalent classes. There are unicast, multicast,
broadcast, and experimental IPv4 addresses, and unicast addresses can be ei­
ther public or private. There are also two different versions of IP addresses cur­
rently in use on the Internet, IPv4 and IPv6. We will focus on IPv4 unicast public
IP addresses, since these are not only the most common, but also the most im­
portant. This is roughly the range of IP addresses from 1.0.0.0 to
223.255.255.255, with some breaks in the middle for private IP address space.
Why is it being organized? IP addresses are the foundation of network connec­
tivity and the Internet; they identify each device on a computer network and al­
so serve as its address, so that routers and other devices can locate and commu­
nicate with it. You cannot get online without one. IP addresses can be represen­
ted into blocks, or subnetworks, using a prefix and a mask. For example,
169.229.216.0/24 represents all IP addresses in the range of 169.229.216.1 –
169.229.216.255. Internet routers do not have enough memory to hold routes
for every individual IP address on the Internet. So by organizing the Internet in­
to subnetworks based loosely on a hierarchical model, routers are able to deter­
mine the correct path for every destination in the network without actually stor­
ing every address in their memory. If the organization of IP addresses is not
handled properly, Internet routers would exhaust their memory space and parts
of the Internet would become unreachable.
How much is it being organized? Currently there is too much granularity in the
global Internet routing table. For a router it takes the same amount of memory
to store a subnetwork with 255 IP addresses as it does to store a subnetwork
with 65536 addresses. So if our main concern is to minimize memory usage in
592

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

Internet routers, thereby lowering operator costs and increasing stability, we
want as little granularity as possible in the Internet routing table. The problem
is that many organizations use non-contiguous IP subnetworks that cannot be
aggregated into larger subnetworks. This results in routers having to store
many small subnetworks instead of fewer larger subnetworks, which will even­
tually lead to memory exhaustion in older routers and possible reachability is­
sues. Currently the full Internet routing table is approaching 500,000 routes.
Most network engineers expect problems once the routing table grows past
512,000 entries, since router memory limitations are always at bit boundaries.
When is it being organized? IP addresses are organized once someone config­
ures one on a device or sets up a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
server. If an organization exhausts their supply of free IP addresses. it will have
to make a request to the upstream provider or Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
for more address space. In the early days of the Internet, large blocks of IP ad­
dresses were given to organizations, but this led to many of the addresses in
these blocks not being used. We are now reaching a point where we no longer
have new addresses to assign to organizations.
Markets are now emerging for organizations to buy and sell IP addresses, and
the organizations who have held on to large amounts of unused addressing
space stand to make significant revenue from selling their unused space. When
these organizations sell their unused IP address space, they will break up large
allocations into smaller subnetworks, thereby increasing granularity and further
accelerating the growth of the Internet routing table.
How or by whom is it being organized? The Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN) is currently responsible for initial allocation of IP
addresses. They allocate 8 blocks of IP addresses to RIRs, who are then respon­
sible for distributing allocations to organizations that request them. These or­
ganizations can then allocate IP addresses to smaller organizations, thus form­
ing a loose hierarchy of organizations, where each level lower in the hierarchy
receives a subset of the IP address space from the organization above it. ICANN
no longer has any /8 blocks of IP addresses left to allocate to RIRs. Once all of
the RIRs have exhausted their last allocations from ICANN, organizations will
have to rely on secondary markets to increase their IP address space.
Other Considerations. The world of IP addressing will soon get a lot more inter­
esting. The introduction of IPv6 as a replacement for IPv4 has been slow in com­
ing and, while gathering momentum, continues at a snail’s pace. As organiza­
tions start purchasing IP addresses from one another, we should expect in­
creased granularity and decreased stability in the Internet routing infrastruc­
ture. Whether or not normal Internet users notice will ultimately be determined
by how well equipment vendors and engineers expediently address the coming
problems.

12.14 The Art Genome Project
By David Eicke, December 2014.
What is being organized? Artsy.net carries the ambitious mission of making “all
the world’s art” accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. This is not
only challenging purely from a scale perspective, with the number of artworks
in the world daunting even if it were not being incremented constantly, but it is
also challenging in that “art” is a nebulous term. Creators of music and litera­
ture often refer to themselves and each other as “artists.” The same goes for
dancers and other performers. Will their works be included? The current collec­
tion seems to be mostly visual art, with some architecture and design objects in­
cluded.
Artsy’s mission is to be carried out by their Art Genome Project, which is the or­
ganizational engine that powers their search and interactions. The name was in­
spired by Pandora’s project, as was their term for their organizing process: “ge­
noming.” Genoming is not yet automated and still costly, so Artsy selects the art
that is to be “genomed” carefully. Their first priority is the works featured in
galleries with whom Artsy has contracts. Galleries pay to have their work organ­
ized and searchable on the site. Those works, then, must be genomed quickly in
order to keep the company running. Artsy’s engine also takes in works from mu­
seums and other institutions who do not have contracts with them, but many of
those institutions have image-rights concerns, and not all their artworks can be
published. In other cases, the images of the works are simply too low-quality to
be displayed.
Why is it being organized? Why organize art? The simplest answer is to educate.
That said, art has been being organized into movements and -isms for a very
long time. The Getty Foundation even created an authoritative art vocabulary
called the Categories for the Description of Works of Art a few decades ago. At
first glance, Artsy seems to be reinventing the wheel. However, the organizing
system Artsy uses is unique in that it facilitates a special kind of interaction
with its body of published works.
The way resources are organized on Artsy is a cross between a hierarchical
structure and a graph structure. They have over 1,000 characteristics (which
they call “genes”) to describe their resources. These characteristics can have to
do with art movements, formal qualities, techniques, subject, etc. The emphasis
here, however, is on relationships between works of art. For example, one of the
genes Artsy uses is “eye-contact,” and if you have a photo taken last month
where the subject is looking directly into the camera and an oil painting from
hundreds of years ago where the subject’s eyes are looking at the painter, those

594

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

two can be one click away from each other. No other organizing system could
facilitate that sort of easy link between two such disparate works.
This free-flowing linkage between works enables the “berry-picking” model of
knowledge seeking, where a user searching for something doesn’t necessarily
have to know what he or she is searching for. A user could begin her exploration
with only a vague notion that she enjoys this long-legged rhinoceros sculpture
by Salvador Dali. She may not know what she likes about it, but she will see his
other work there. Maybe she finds a painting she likes in the “other works by
Dali” section, and she clicks on it. Then the characteristics of this painting are
listed in the interface, and she is free to click on any one of them. She might
click on “Surrealism” and find more works from that movement. She may click
on “waterscapes” and find other oceanic imagery. She is free to explore and dis­
cover art in a self-directed way and free to discover what she likes and why she
likes it. The director of Artsy’s Art Genome Project says the system was inten­
ded to parallel a professor who is adept at “riffing” on things.
How much is it being organized? As mentioned above, Artsy currently uses over
1,000 characteristics (“genes”) to describe its resources. These characteristics
can describe anything from the art’s form to the art’s subject to the technique
used to create the art. Experts assign these genes to the artworks and then as­
sign those genes a weight from 0 to 100, depending on the salience of the char­
acteristic within the work. Aside from the genes, the art is described in terms of
physical dimensions (how much space it takes up), whether it has been sold or
not, its gallery, its price (if for sale), its creation date, and, of course, who cre­
ated it. Having such a rich set of descriptions has allowed Artsy to create a pub­
lic API for developers to use all of this information as they see fit.
When is it being organized? Description of Artsy’s resources is an ongoing proc­
ess. Their ingested collection of art is much larger than their published collec­
tion. Most of the artworks are waiting to be genomed, with some of them wait­
ing for permissions or image-rights paperwork to process. Another factor in de­
termining when something is organized is the signing of new contracts with gal­
leries. Works from galleries with contracts have first priority, and Artsy experts
genome those works as they come in.
While these experts are assigning genes on a rolling basis, they are also draw­
ing upon hundreds of years of art history scholarship when assigning them. For
example, the Arsty experts did not come up with Dadaism as an organizational
concept. So, in a way, some of these works were organized long ago.
How or by whom is it being organized? Artsy has a team of art historians and
experts working to describe the resources that Artsy has ingested (and those
that it will ingest). They have done some experiments with image-recognition
software, but its descriptions are simply not rich enough to facilitate the sorts of
interactions the organization is trying to facilitate. The strategy of employing
12.14 The Art Genome Project

595

The Discipline of Organizing

experts has its obvious downsides, however. It does not scale well, and it is rem­
iniscent of Yahoo’s early strategy of employing librarians to describe web con­
tent. There will also be inevitable biases in human resource description.
Other considerations. With such a grand ambition, one thing that may stand in
Artsy’s way of becoming an authoritative organizing system in the art space is
that they are for-profit. Even if they are able to avoid too much bias in the inter­
est of revenue generation, the perception remains that they are less interested
in classifying art for educational purposes and more interested in making mon­
ey.

12.15 Making a Documentary Film
By Suhaib Syed, December 2013.
Overview. As part of a small crew, I was in pursuit of making a documentary film
shedding light on the problems in the higher education system in India. We had
traveled far and wide, capturing many thought-provoking stories, illuminating
interviews, and shocking truths. Due to the relatively small crew and a tight
schedule, we ended up with our raw footage being labeled in a generic format
(MVI_1234 etc.). I, being the director, had the task of assisting the editor in re­
naming and reorganizing the files to make our lives easier, do justice to all the
efforts that were put into capturing all the clips, and incorporate them in an im­
pactful manner.
What is being organized? The primary resources being organized were the vid­
eo clips (digital, shot on DSLRs) acquired during the shoot. In this context, they
could be classified as passive resources having no real capability to produce any
significant value on their own, and which had to be acted upon or interacted
with to produce any effect. But the key problem here was to formulate usable
resource descriptions based on the following resource properties:
Intrinsic static
Date and time of creation, duration of the clip, type of external lighting used,
camera used, lens used, exposure, ISO, white balance, frame rate, compres­
sion type
Extrinsic static
Shot sequence number (assigned to each story element during storyboarding), shot movement type (dolly, follow focus, zoom, macro, etc.)
During this particular stage, the intrinsic and extrinsic dynamic properties did
not play a large role in the resource descriptions.
We had done a lot of work on story-boarding and identified the right level of
granularity so that we could capture each shot sequence separately, so we di­

596

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

rectly used the shot sequence number as an important part of the resource de­
scription. This helped us keeping our descriptions short and meaningful.
Additionally, we realized that the corresponding audio clips captured along with
the video also had to be organized, but since the two were intricately linked to
each other we decided to use the same name as the corresponding video clip,
the only difference being the extension. We relied on the editing software to
capture the intrinsic static properties of the audio files (e.g., bit rate and com­
pression type).
Why is it being organized? Essentially, we were organizing these digital resour­
ces to find, identify, and select them so as to weave a powerful narrative ena­
bling us to convey the truth in an impactful manner.
Hence, the interactions were directly with the primary resource.
The interactions that had to be supported by our organization scheme involved:
• Finding the clips related to a particular story-board section
• Selecting the best set of clips to be included in the film based on relevance
to story, progression, continuation and several other inter-connected factors
• Manipulating the clip (i.e., color-correcting, white balancing, and stabilizing)
to create an aesthetic effect
• Matching the video of a clip to corresponding audio recording
• Adding the right background score based on sentiment being portrayed in
the clips and the progression of the story
• Providing subtitles in case of a foreign language or incoherent speech
How much is it being organized? Since the scope and size of our organizing sys­
tem was relatively limited and all the resources were already available, we were
able to make some bold decisions without causing a lot of problems. We formed
a controlled, vertical vocabulary for resource description by deliberately choos­
ing certain resource properties over others. Our main objective was to keep the
description as short as possible and at the same time convey the most valuable
information that would help us interact with the resources (i.e., the video clips).
We could have easily opted for a date- and time-stamp based id and every re­
source in a collection (i.e., clips specific to one camera) would have a unique
identifier, but we realized that our cameras already attached this information to
the file along with the technical details like frame rate, aperture, shutter speed,
ISO, and white balance, which our operating system and editing software could
easily capture, display, and search through, hence, we decided not to use these
details.

12.15 Making a Documentary Film

597

The Discipline of Organizing

We also decided not to include important lighting condition properties (kino-flo,
LeikoLite, etc.) and location, because the first frame in most of our clips consis­
ted of the clap-board which contained all of this information, and our editing
software showed all the video files as thumbnails using first frame of the video.
Thus we leveraged all of these to form a controlled vocabulary that placed the
shot sequence number first, followed by the take number followed by camera
identifier (e.g., camA, camB, etc.). For instance: 2A_1_camB.
However, we did realize that these decisions were specific to our OS and video
editing software and hence lacked interoperability.
When is it being organized? In our case, although we intended to organize the
resources as soon as they were acquired, we failed and then came up with an
organizing system after all the resources were acquired. We leveraged this fact
to our benefit and formed a more specific description system.
How or by whom is it being organized? Ideally it is the role of the first assistant
cinematographer (AC), even 2nd or 3rd AC (depending on the budget), to make
sure all the file names are stored properly and all the cards properly backed up.
But due to our limitations we (i.e., the director and cinematographer) collabora­
ted to organize the set of raw footage.
Other considerations. One important consideration that we left out in the dis­
cussion was the need for certain people appearing in the documentary to have
their identity hidden by means of facial blurring and voice modulation. Although
we could not accommodate this interaction of identifying which clips had foot­
age of people who did not want to reveal themselves, we could easily add the
special effects over an entire sequence once all the clips were brought together.

12.16 The Dabbawalas of Mumbai
Indian Lunch Box System
By Pratibha Rathore, December 2014.
Overview. The Mumbai dabbawala tiffin service is the source of much fascina­
tion from around the world, and I am no different: I worked in Mumbai for two
years and used the services of dabbawalas to get my lunch box (called a “dab­
ba”) delivered from home to my office, which was about 44 miles away. Without
the use of any technology or digital resources, this organizing system has been
coordinating the delivery of home-cooked lunches to thousands of Indian office
workers for over a century, charging just a small fee of $3-7 per month. The
community of dabbawalas has been able to create value for its customers by op­
timizing and standardizing the principles of its operations and devising an or­
ganizing system that is down to earth and human-centric.

598

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

What is being organized? The primary resources in the dabbawala system are
the dabbas that are delivered to respective customer’s offices and organized us­
ing a simple but effective color-coding system. The secondary resource is the
workforce, consisting of 5,000–6,000 people known as dabbawalas, who organ­
ize themselves and their supporting supply chain and logistics operations to de­
liver the dabbas to the right location and at the right time each day without fail­
ure. The dabbawala community, called the Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Associa­
tion (MTBSA), follows a flat organization structure, meaning the motivation to
perform consistently is a matter of personal drive and accountability.
Why is it being organized? The primary reason people use the service of the
dabbawalas is to eat a proper, home-prepared meal during lunch, a way to con­
nect with their family while busy at work. The interactions supported by the
dabbawala organizing system provide two significant benefits to the customers:
managing their budgets while eating healthy, and leveraging time constraints.
Most of the office-goers usually leave by 7 a.m. to commute from the suburbs of
Mumbai, traveling south to the main commercial area of Mumbai and returning
back home after 7 p.m. The railway network during the peak hours is jampacked with commuters hanging onto the trains with one hand; therefore, carry­
ing one’s lunch at that time is not feasible. Most of the commuters cannot afford
to eat takeout every day, and eating on the roadside is unhealthy and unhygien­
ic. In addition, catering to the diverse food habits and taste needs of employees
is very difficult for office canteens to manage. Thankfully, the dabbawala system
solves all these problems with 100 percent customer satisfaction by delivering
to each employee his lunch filled with food prepared at his home.
How much is it being organized? The Mumbai lunch box system is a successful
and a socially sustainable enterprise. The number of dabbas delivered per day
to offices and back home is around 300,000; that means 600,000 transactions
per day. Although the number of transactions is very large, each person handles
a small subset of transactions at a time. The scope of the organizing system and
the scale of operations pretty much remain consistent, with the addition or dele­
tion of few dabbas every month. Most interestingly, despite the lack of comput­
ers, mobile technology, or any automated processes, a dabba goes astray only
once every two months, making less than one mistake in every 6 million deliver­
ies. Now that’s efficiency! The system is able to achieve consistency in its opera­
tions because of successful implementation of several organizing principles.
Firstly, containers used to house the lunch boxes are of a standard shape and
size. Second, the color coding done on the dabbas takes advantage of people's
visual acuity, following a human-centric design approach. Third, the sequence of
transactions to deliver each dabba from its source to destination and back to
source is repeatable, predictable, systematic, and iterative in nature, enabling
easy tracking and monitoring. Finally, governance within the community is ach­

12.16 The Dabbawalas of Mumbai

599

The Discipline of Organizing

ieved by instilling ethics, values, and principles in employees and by holding
employees accountable at all times.
When is it being organized? The interactions between dabbawalas to deliver the
dabbas follow a “hub and spoke” process model. During a dabba’s journey from
kitchen to consumer, it is handled by between three and twelve different deliv­
erymen. The typical day for a dabbawala begins at 9:30 a.m., and he spends
about an hour collecting all the 25–30 dabbas from the assigned set of homes in
his designated area. The households are expected to have the lunch box ready
when he arrives for collection. When he is done with collection, he goes to the
local train station and gathers with the other dabbawalas of his area. Next, the
dabbas are sorted in the order of stops on that rail line and handed off to the
dabbawala who is responsible for that particular station for delivery to their fi­
nal destination. At every departure station, the dabbas are passed out according
to their next destinations. The same process is repeated when returning empty
dabbas back to homes.

Informatics Edition

How or by whom is it being organized? The key to this successful delivery man­
agement system is the color coding done on the dabbas. The dabbawalas use
simple design measures such as signs, different colors, numbers, dashes, dots,
letters, and simple symbols to indicate various parameters such as origination
suburb, route to take, destination station, who is responsible, the street, build­
ing, floor, etc. As most of the dabbawals are illiterate, the choice of syntax for
markings is done in such a way to ensure it is easy to understand and imple­
ment. The vocabulary used to implement and describe markings on the dabbas
follows a standardized and self-descriptive process, thereby eliminating ambigu­
ity and variability and making the organizing system more effective. Since only
numbers and letters are used, the syntax for description of the primary resource
(dabbas) is intentionally made to be independent of any local language, so that
everyone can learn, understand, and process without any confusion, bias, or in­
formation overload.

Figure 12.4. Dabba Routing Codes

A breakdown of the coding system used to identify and route a dabba.

At each stage of the process, only one part of this code needs to be read, which
works as a signal and thus allows picking up the right dabbas very quickly. It is
also particularly efficient for traceability, since any dabbawala seeing a dabba
knows which path it has to take. In case a dabba is lost or forbidden some­
where, any dabbawala is able to put it back on the right track. There is no need
for the structure of color coding to be more granular than described above, as
dabbawalas know the collection areas by heart. Furthermore, the process of
adding a new resource to the organizing system is straightforward and struc­

tured. If a new resource—that is, a new customer—is added to the system, the
dabbawala will do the complete journey to check the address of delivery and co­
ordinate with other colleagues in the community to see who has a free place in
his crate to add one more dabba. Once the sequence of delivery has been estab­
lished and all the necessary stops for exchange decided, the address on the dab­
ba is marked and it becomes part of the whole system.
Other considerations. It would be interesting to know if this delivery model
could be used by other cities as the problem of longer commute and need for
homemade food for lunch by office workers is always there in major cities. In
my view, standardization of operations and understanding cultural and regional
biases can provide opportunities for other cities to implement this model, at the
same time providing jobs to many semi-skilled workforces.

12.17 Managing Information About Data Center Resources
By Hassan Jannah, December 2013.
Overview. Nowadays, there is an app for almost everything! Yet, we show little
or no regard to what happens behind our shiny little screen until something
breaks down and our lives descend to near chaos. That is the conundrum of IT
guys. The truth is that IT solutions are, in many cases, fragile things that need
constant care. This is no easy task. In fact, most of the cost and effort involved
in IT solutions is maintenance. A million things could go wrong. Words like pre­
ventive maintenance, service monitoring, business continuity, and disaster re­
covery are examples of the different activities done to maximize availability, and
expedite troubleshooting. Everyone involved with these activities needs access
to resources. Above all, they all need access to information.
What is being organized? IT data centers have both physical and digital resour­
ces. Physical resources include the facility (i.e., building), utilities, computer
hardware (e.g., network switches, cables, servers, storage, etc.), and, also peo­
ple. Digital resources are much fuzzier to define. A simplistic approach could
classify them into data and applications. Each category can be further subclassified into an entire ontology. The complexity increases when you consider
the great number of potential resource types that can be created by combining
physical and digital resources. Capturing, storing, and maintaining information
about these resources is a big challenge. A lot of information can be retrieved
from the resources themselves. Usually, each team responsible for supporting a
certain group of resources would store information in spreadsheets and docu­
ments. More organized teams would use databases or knowledge management
systems. More diligent organizations would have a central repository for every­
thing.

What many fail to capture is the information about how all of these different
clusters of resources are interconnected. That is often a much bigger and com­
plex challenge. That information could be either buried deep in these systems
(e.g., the user name used to run a certain service), or is stored in people’s
brains. The added value of an organizing system for data about data center re­
sources can be multiplied if effectively organized information about their inter­
actions.
Why is it being organized? Running an IT data center is complex, resource in­
tensive, and risky. Customers require around the clock availability of services
with no room for failure. The consequences of such failures go beyond financial
loss and customer dissatisfaction. They could affect people’s safety and, even,
national security. Cyber threats have become a constant threat for IT service
providers, especially those that host highly sensitive data or serve critical oper­
ations. People can survive if their emails were inaccessible for an hour. Howev­
er, what are the ramifications of a total failure of the IT infrastructure of the
New York Stock Exchange? What if the airport systems of Heathrow airport
failed? These are some of the conditions that IT data center managers must
work in. Furthermore, technology advances have created highly diverse, com­
plex, and integrated solutions. New resources are introduced frequently as old
resources are retired. These activities require careful planning and execution to
prevent the intricate eco-system from crashing. Having all the information re­
quired to plan these activities would mitigate that risk.
Nevertheless, when something wrong does happen, having the required infor­
mation is equally important to expedite fixing it. In fact, availability of informa­
tion increases with the severity of the problem. How can you rebuild a system if
you do not know how to connect its parts? How much are the resources organ­
ized? The granularity of the data required about data center resources varies
between organizations and also between stakeholders of the same organization.
The information can be classified into operational, and planning information.
How much is it being organized? Operational information is required for running
day-to-day operations. These include information about resources and how they
are interconnected. Many organizations put most of their focus on organizing
operational information with high granularity. The granularity could be influ­
enced by economic, political, an intellectual factors. Higher granularity means
that more time and money are required to organize the information.
The level of granularity used to describe a resource type can be driven by the
motives of the team leading the activity. For example, a hardware systems sup­
port team would invest more in building a robust organizing system for hard­
ware systems and not focus on applications running on that hardware. Finally,
the team’s intellectual abilities and knowledge would influence the granularity
of the system. As the boundaries between physical and digital resources fade,

12.17 Managing Information About Data Center Resources

603

The Discipline of Organizing

system designers could face some challenging questions. For example, servers
are, traditionally, considered hardware resources. However, many organization
have switched to virtual servers running on big machines. In such a case, how
would you define a server? Is it the big machine or the individual virtual serv­
ers? Is it a physical resource or a digital resource? If you have a standby clone
of a virtual server, would you consider both to be the same entity or not?
Planning information is usually required to make business decisions and is usu­
ally less granular. This could include information about the purchase and main­
tenance costs, contracts, hardware life-times …etc. Managers and planners
could use this information to better plan for business activities, manage opera­
tional and capital costs, and make strategic decisions about the services and
products the data center offers.
When is it being organized? Many data centers start building an organizing sys­
tem of data about their resources based on existing resources. In such cases,
building the system is the easy part. The real challenge is maintaining the infor­
mation up-to-date in an ever-changing environment. Clear information life-cycle
and change management processes are required in parallel with work processes
to ensure information is updated.
How or by whom is it being organized? Based on the scope and level of granu­
larity of the system, the number of resources could potentially be gargantuan.
The organization must try to maximize the amount of information collected au­
tomatically using auto discovery “agents” to keep update information. Inevita­
bly, other information, especially information describing interdependencies, will
require human entry. The organization must have a clear and comprehensive
governance framework that details the roles and responsibilities of different
parties in adding, and maintaining information.
Other considerations. Most big companies in the past operated their own corpo­
rate data centers. Their organizing system might have a smaller scope. The
emergence of global cloud service providers has extended the commoditization
of IT products and services across the entire technology landscape; from the
consumers all the way back to the servers that provide them. These providers
will have a bigger scope due to the diversity and dynamic provisioning of their
services.

12.18 Neuroscience Lab
By Colin Gerber, December 2013.
Overview. A neuroscience lab is doing Parkinson’s disease research in which
they do experiments with rats. They use different types of rats, surgeries, and
drugs for experiments and have to keep track of all this information for data
analysis, publications, and lab inspectors.
The existing organizing system was developed before personal computers were
prevalent and has slowly evolved over time. However, much of the underlying
structure of the system still has its roots in pre-computer concepts. In order to
update the system to incorporate more modern technologies what are the
changes to the resources, their descriptions, and the systems structure that
need to be made?
What is being organized? Resources in the current organizing system include
rats, surgeries, experiments, drugs, and data recorded from the experiments.
There are some other resources that could be incorporated into the organizing
system.
One such new resource is surgery techniques. Surgery techniques have histori­
cally been passed down by the master apprentice method and information was
largely tacit knowledge that was held by the researchers performing the surger­
ies and not explicitly in the system. This was done because it is inherently diffi­
cult to store the intricacies of surgery in text and even more difficult for a new
researcher to learn how to perform the surgery from textual information. The
ability to store and annotate multimedia changes this however. It is now possi­
ble to make instructional videos for each type of surgery, add resource descrip­
tions to the video file and store it in the organizing system.
There is also a resource that is treated as one resource through its entire life­
time when it may actually be two. When rats are originally brought into the or­
ganizing system they are treated as a manifestation of the rat resource type.
Meaning the rats are interchangeable, you can use any rat from that group in
your surgery. Once the surgery has been performed the rat is modified into a
new resource instance. The specific rat the surgery was performed on now has
a new set of resource descriptions.
Why is it being organized? Is the main purpose of the organization system to
make sure the correct rats are used in each different experiment? Or is it to
make sure the records are kept up to date for the lab inspectors? It could also
be making data analysis and paper writing more efficient. These decisions will
affect how many different types of resource descriptions are required and the
granularity needed for those descriptions.

Neuroscience Research
Equipment

Physical resources in the author's lab
are arranged to facilitate the precise
accuracy of interactions required in
medical research. In this photo, an
array of amplifiers and filters for pro­
cessing and recording rats' brain­
wave signals (left) is installed in a
vertical rack that can be located close
to the equipment used to perform
surgeries.

This system is just one of many organ­
izing systems within a lab so deciding
the scope and interactions it will have
with the other organizing systems is
very important. One important deci­
sion is if the system will support the
training of new members of the lab or
not. Having resources such as video
recording of surgeries and experi­
ments could enable teaching interac­
tions for new researchers. But there
are many other aspects of training a
new researcher must go through,
should these also be included in the
organizing system? If so, it would
make the system much more complex
and expand the scope of the organiz­
ing system outside of surgeries and
experiments but would keep all of the
teaching resource in one system.
Another option would be to have a
separate organizing system that is re­
sponsible for training material which
is able to interact with the multimedia
in the system that are relevant to
training. This does not expand the
scope of the system but would make
the maintenance of it more difficult.
Each time a surgery technique or ex­
periment is changed two systems
would have to be updated to take the
changes into account.

How much is it being organized? The
system is accessed by many types of
users, each requiring a different type
of interaction. The researchers need
to search for the correct rat and surgery technique. The lab inspector needs to
check for drug logs and make sure all the surgery methods and equipment are
up to date. The principal investigator needs to see an overview of progress on
projects.

Currently the system is organized in hierarchical categories where the top-level
categories are surgery and experiments. This organization makes it easy to re­
606

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

trieve specific resources. However, the interactions normally performed with
the system use resources from both sub-trees, which makes the hierarchical ap­
proach less than optimal.
A faceted classification approach could work well to enable these interactions.
The facets would incorporate the original categories of surgery and experiments
but also add facets for each common type of interaction. In this case different
resource descriptions of the same resource will often be classified into different
facets. These resource descriptions will often act as resources themselves. For
example, a lab inspector is interested in retrieving the expiration date and times
a drug was used in surgery, not the drug itself.
When is it being organized? In a neuroscience lab resource descriptions are of­
ten lost if they are not recorded at the time they are measured. For example, if a
rat is weighed to calculate the correct dosage of a drug, both the dosage and
the weight should be entered into the system. If the weight is not entered at the
time of measurement it would be impossible to weigh the rat later and get the
same result (as the rat changes weight over time.) This is a common problem,
so as a rule all resources and descriptions should be entered into the system at
the time they are acquired.
How or by whom is it being organized? The researchers working in the lab do all
of the organizing. They are the ones creating new resources, descriptions and
have the most knowledge about the resources and how they relate to each oth­
er.
Other considerations. Changing the system and entering all of the data at the
time of measurement will initially cause more work for the researchers but will
result in more accuracy for the interactions supported by the system and less
retrieval work during data analysis and paper writing.

12.19 A Nonprofit Book Publisher
By Emily Paul, December 2014.
Overview. The New Press, a nonprofit book publisher with approximately 1,000
published titles, roughly 800 of which are actively in print and featured on the
website, updated its book categories for use on thenewpress.com as part of a
website redesign. Rather than fully adhering to an established book classifica­
tion system, such as BISAC, which is commonly used in book retail, The New
Press developed its own classification system. In addition to the standard goal
of allowing readers to browse categories, this classification system is designed
to represent the press’s focus and mission. The New Press classification system
employs a mix of principles and levels of granularity while incorporating some
elements of the institutional categories from BISAC.

The Discipline of Organizing

In order to gain some insight into how these dual goals affect usability, I ran
user tests on a mockup of the website with the proposed categories. I conducted
a think-aloud exercise in which the users verbalized their thoughts as they
browsed through the categories and subcategories. I then asked the users to
walk through where they would go for a particular book in response to a prompt
from me that included the book’s title, subtitle, and a brief description. Lastly, I
asked the users about what their impressions were of The New Press after look­
ing at the categories, whether they were confused by the categories, and which
categories they would be interested in looking at if they visited the site.
What is being organized? The resource being organized is the digital presence
of the books on thenewpress.com. The classification system is only used on The
New Press website and is stored in a FileMaker database that pushes data to
the website. There is already a dedicated website classification system that this
new system builds on. It is worth noting that the book records in the database
also contain BISAC categories. These are entered so that they can be sent out to
distribution and bookseller feeds that require the industry-standard categories.
The BISAC categories are institutional categories created by the Book Industry
Standards Group. The BISAC system is designed to reflect the interests and un­
derstanding of general readers. As such, the BISAC categories are informed by
cultural categories and also influence cultural categories because of their broad
adoption in the book industry. In addition to using some institutional categories
from BISAC and mainstream cultural categories, The New Press is using cultur­
al categories from specific groups, namely academics and political progressives,
to connect with specific readers.
Why is it being organized? The books are being categorized to facilitate brows­
ing by readers and supporters on The New Press website. In addition to the pri­
mary browsing interaction, the categories are also being used as an opportunity
to position The New Press and to convey a sense of its mission.
How much is it being organized? For the purposes of The New Press website,
books can be placed in multiple categories and subcategories, but all books will
have at least one category designation. Because The New Press is not con­
cerned with the physical presentation of the resources, the books can be placed
in as many categories as are relevant. In contrast, library and bookstore classifi­
cations need to satisfy the uniqueness principle, because the book can only be
located in one physical location.
Most of the categories are based on the subject matter of the books. A book’s
subject matter is an intrinsic static property because it does not change once it
is published. However, the categories used to describe this subject matter may
change over time as new categories are added to the classification system and
retroactively assigned to previously published books. The book subject catego­
ries can generally be thought of as extrinsic and static because the threshold for

608

Chapter 12 — Case Studies

Informatics Edition

changing them is higher than it is for more dynamic properties such as Current
Season, Next Season, and Bestsellers. These categories are also included on the
site in a separate section and are all extrinsic, dynamic properties because they
are based either on time or sales, rather than intrinsic properties of the books.
The New Press classification system includes hierarchical categories, though
only the subjects in which the press publishes more extensively have subcatego­
ries. In areas for which there are more books, the organization can be more
granular without creating a subcategory that contains only one or a few books.
Additionally, the greater institutional knowledge of the subject area enables the
staff to make more specific distinctions within the broader subject category. One
of the questions I explored in my user testing was whether these differentiations
are necessary to support users’ interactions with the books. If the users do not
share the same level of knowledge in the subject it may not be useful, and may
even diminish usability, to differentiate at the level of granularity provided by
the subcategories.
Even at the top category level, there is a range of granularity and also a range
of principles embodied in the categories. For example, History and Immigration
are both top-level categories, but Immigration covers a more specific group of
topics than History does. Most categories are based on the subject of the books,
but there are several top-level categories based on other principles. These in­
clude Graphic Nonfiction, which refers to format; Primary Source Documents,
which refers to the source material; and Biography, which refers to the genre of
the book but does not express anything about its subject matter beyond the fact
that it is about someone’s life. Mixing category principles can be useful, particu­
larly in a faceted system, which allows users to combine different categories to
increase precision. In a faceted version of this system, a user could select Biog­
raphy and Law in order to find biographies written about a judge or lawyer. Be­
cause books are assigned to all relevant categories in this system, this interac­
tion is feasible at the logic level even though the current presentation does not
allow it. If The New Press wanted to switch to a faceted presentation it would
likely visually separate the categories into blocks based on the principles, so
that users knew which facets they could pivot their searches on. This might in­
clude creating a genre section with Biography, Oral History, and Primary Source
Documents as well as a geography section with the subcategories from World.
When is it being organized? Once the updated categories are finalized, all previ­
ously published books will be reviewed and assigned to new categories as nec­
essary. Going forward, new books will be categorized on a seasonal basis and
new categories may occasionally be assigned to previously published books on
an ad hoc basis (this could be due to previous oversight in not assigning the cat­
egory, or to the creation of a new category or subcategory). This system is flexi­
ble because books can be assigned to all relevant categories, so the introduction
of a new category does not mean that all previous assignments will need to be
12.19 A Nonprofit Book Publisher

609

The Discipline of Organizing

changed. The subcategories also allow for flexibility because if one of these cat­
egories becomes more important over time, it can be changed at the presenta­
tion layer to a top-level category with minimal effort.
How or by whom is it being organized? The sales, marketing, and inventory
manager assigns the categories, with input from the editorial and marketing
teams. From time to time other departments, such as fundraising or publicity,
may suggest a new category or category assignment for consideration. The cat­
egories are assigned in a FileMaker database in which the categories can be se­
lected from a list of existing categories and subcategories. The category assign­
ments in the FileMaker database are pushed to the website along with other
book data.
Other considerations. Creating a classification system that can be widely under­
stood is difficult to do. In this case, simplifying the system would support The
New Press’s goal of reaching a broad audience of readers. User testing revealed
that the current category system may be hindering this because of issues with
semantics, granularity, and structure. The structural issues are the most impor­
tant to address because the inconsistent use of subcategories generated signifi­
cant confusion during the user testing. By removing the subcategories and in­
stead allowing expert users or those who know exactly what they are looking for
to use search, the press could maximize the categories’ relevance for general
readers. This could be strengthened by an emphasis on using relevant keywords
in the book descriptions that support searching. Despite some initial surprise
from the test users about certain unusual top-level categories, I would argue
that after simplifying other aspects of the system, the press could successfully
keep some of these in order to represent its publishing areas and connect with
like-minded readers. For example, Immigration and Criminal Justice are not toplevel BISAC categories, but are easily understood by general readers and serve
to highlight these important areas for The New Press. Biases in classification
systems are unavoidable. While this can be negative, particularly when the or­
ganizers are not aware of the biases, it can also be harnessed positively and
used to communicate a sense of the organization and its values. This needs to
be approached thoughtfully and carefully and tested on users to understand
how people outside the organization will interact with the system.

Afterword

We have reached the end of this book, but we are just at the beginning of “the
discipline of organizing.” We hope that we have demonstrated why thinking of
the art and science of organizing in a more abstract way can enable communica­
tion and cooperation across the numerous disciplines that are concerned with
organizing, especially library and information science, computer science, infor­
matics, law, economics, and business. Instead of just appropriating concepts
and methods from these fields, we have tried to unify them, filling in the gaps
between their complementary perspectives to yield a more comprehensive and
generative understanding of how they fit together.
Now it is your turn. Perhaps you have a job in one of the fields we have brought
together that involves organizing resources of one type or another. After read­
ing this book, you surely will not approach that work the same way you did be­
fore. You will be able to apply the design patterns and principles of The Disci­
pline of Organizing to make your existing organizing systems more capable, and
will be able to create entirely new ones that fill the white space between the tra­
ditional categories.
We encourage people who read this book to contribute their own case studies at
DisciplineOfOrganizing.org, and we expect to incorporate the most interesting
and entertaining ones into this collection.

Philosophers, scientists, designers, and many others have sought to make sense
of how we organize our physical and intellectual worlds for over two thousand
years. We owe a great general obligation to all of them, so we dedicated this
book to them. However, it is more important to acknowledge more specifically
the people who made The Discipline of Organizing happen. I think it is befitting
of a book about organizing to be organized in making these acknowledgments,
as follows in three categories:

The Motivators
Annalee Saxenian, the Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Information, chal­
lenged me in 2005 to teach the “Information Organization and Retrieval” course
required of all entering graduate students and provided me with a supportive
environment in which to do it. The lecture notes of my predecessors, Berkeley
colleagues Marti Hearst, Ray Larson, and Mark Davis, provided important intel­
lectual scaffolding as I developed my own syllabus and lectures.
When I discovered the little red book by Elaine Svenonius, The Intellectual
Foundation of Information Organization, my mind opened up to library and in­
formation science. I aspired to write a book that could build on and broaden
those foundations to connect with my own background in cognitive and comput­
er science. A few months later when I met Elaine I was very pleased when she
endorsed this ambitious effort.
I have been continually encouraged by faculty members and deans whenever I
talked about this project at Schools of Information or similar academic units.
These include the U.S. universities of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and North
Carolina, Canadian universities of Toronto and Western Ontario, and European

universities in Vienna and Berlin. In particular, I would like to thank Colin Allen,
Ron Day, Miles Efron, Thomas Finholt, Dan O’Hair, Margaret Hedstrom, Mi­
chael Jones, John King, Kathryn LaBarre, Kelly Lyons, Gary Marchionini, Jerry
McDonough, Allen Renear, Seamus Ross, Victoria Rubin, Michael Seadle, and
Linda Smith. I especially appreciate the encouragement that Deans Marchionini
and Seadle gave to Ryan Shaw and Vivien Petras, two of the principal authors of
this book. I apologize to those of you that I have forgotten to list here.
Margy Avery of The MIT Press has pushed hard when she needed to and has
been very receptive when I needed her to be.

The Contributors
It took me four years of teaching the IO & IR course at Berkeley before I knew
enough (or too little) to think I could put together a book that might replace the
diverse set of textbooks that course was using. I did not realize at the time how
much I was learning from these teaching assistants, and I thank them for not
making it obvious to me. Later on, after the book project was underway, my
teaching assistants were invaluable in pointing out problems with the book, of­
ten proposing their solutions as well.
Almost exactly three years ago the project to write this book began in a gradu­
ate seminar whose goals were to define the topical coverage and structure of
the book, and then to write chapters starting with my course lecture notes.
Among the courageous students in that seminar were many authors of the book
being published here: Rachelle Annechino, J.J.M. Ekaterin, Ryan Greenberg, Jess
Hemerly, Michael Manoochehri, Sean Marimpietri, Kimra McPherson, Karen
Nomorosa, Hyunwoo Park, Dan Turner, and Longhao Wang. Nick Doty, Mohit
Gupta, Erin Knight, and Joyce Tsai also contributed during this start-up period.
In Spring 2011 Erik Wilde and I conducted a seminar titled “Principles and Pat­
terns of Organizing Systems” to refine the key concepts of the evolving book.
This seminar added Brendan Curran, Krishna Janakiraman, Julian Limon, Rowyn
McDonald, Elisa Oreglia, Monica Rosenberg, Karen Rustad, Bailey Smith, Leslie
Tom, and Anne Wootton to the growing set of student contributors. Leslie gets
credit for the book’s title.
In Spring 2012 Andrea Angquist, Jacob Portnoff, and Brian Rea, supervised ca­
pably by Anne Wootton, were essential editorial assistants in my end-to-end ef­
fort to rewrite the drafts of Chapters 1-7 to improve their conceptual integration
and continuity.
I used draft chapters of the book in my IO & IR course three times, beginning in
Fall 2010. The final version of the book in 2013 barely resembles those early
drafts, which means that many students suffered to improve the book. But they
did not suffer passively. Many students submitted problems with the Twitter

hashtag #tdofix, and submitted examples using #tdoexample, which benefited
the book greatly but which surely confused their regular Twitter followers.
Many other Berkeley students did important work on the book. Jen Wang de­
signed the cover; Divya Anand, Ajeeta Dhole, Christina Pham, and Raymon
Sutedjo-The did the illustrations; Lisa Jervis, Shohei Narron, and Anne Wootton
worked on the extensive bibliography. A group of students whose work does not
appear in the printed book but whose efforts will be revealed in future ebooks
include Luis Aguilar, Fred Chasen, Philip Foeckler, Jake Hartnell, Eliot Nahman,
and AJ Renold.
Eliot Kimber showed me that it was possible to write a book that could be pub­
lished simultaneously in print and in ebooks. It has not turned out to be as sim­
ple as someone as talented as Kimber can make it seem, but I am grateful to Eli­
ot for convincing me that I should try to do it. With help from Bob Stayton,
Adam Witwer (and O’Reilly Media) we will get there.
I must also thank Christine Borgman of UCLA for bringing a group of energetic
and thoughtful UCLA graduate students into the project. Two of them, Matt
Mayernik and Alberto Pepe, are contributing authors. Amelia Acker, Jillian
Wallis, and Laura Wynholds taught me a great deal about libraries and archives,
and I am certain they tried to teach me much more than I was able to learn.
Many people read draft chapters and were thankfully unsparing in their criti­
cism because they wanted to make this book as good as it could be. Thank you
Scott Abel, Larry Barsalou, Marcia Bates, Christine Borgman, Michael Cohen,
David Kirsh, Jeff Elman, Rob Goldstone, Jonathan Grudin, Ben Hill, Mano Marks,
Patrick Schmitz, Elaine Svenonius, Jeff Zych, and everyone else whom I have
carelessly forgotten.
Few books have been as battle tested before they went to print as this one. Let
me thank those who have been willing to teach from a book that did not entirely
exist: Jane Greenberg, Irith Hartman, Lauren Plews, Sarah Ramdeen, Christian
Sandvig, Emily Seitz, Isabelle Sperano, Konstantin Tovstiadi, Hong Zhang, and
especially Vivien Petras and Ryan Shaw who went to battle with (and for) this
book multiple times.

The Essentials
The third and final category of acknowledgments is for people who were essen­
tial, without whom this project would never have been finished.
Jess Hemerly and Kimra McPherson joined the project in the “first campaign” of
Spring 2010, worked tirelessly through that summer to make chapter drafts
course-worthy, and served as teaching assistants in Fall 2010 when the book

was first tested with students. They helped me believe that there might be a
book in there somewhere when it took a lot of faith to see that.
Erik Wilde taught me much through our multi-year collaboration and dialectic
when he was on the Berkeley faculty from 2006-2011. Erik made me understand
the elegance and great scope of the word “resource,” which became the central
concept in this book. His meticulously annotated reviews of many chapters from
a computer science perspective helped inspire the idea of discipline-tagged end­
notes.
Ryan Shaw and Vivien Petras, both young professors at schools a long distance
from Berkeley, found courage in themselves and had confidence in the draft
book coming out of Berkeley in 2011—first to teach with it, and then to help
write it, becoming the primary reviewers of my chapters and the first authors of
Chapters 8 and 9.
Murray Maloney joined the project in April 2012 as copy editor, but we together
soon recognized that his nearly three decades of SGML, XML, and publishing
experience were too valuable not to exploit further for the benefit of this book.
Without Murray’s work as the markup and production editor, indexer and
glossary-maker, there would be too much work left to do and no one capable of
doing it as well as Murray has. Somehow along the way he also found time to
make important intellectual contributions as a co-author in Chapters 5 and 8.
Finally, I want to thank Pam Samuelson. She has been far too patient with me as
I talked with her, to her, and at her for three years while this book was being
written, who turned many quarter-baked ideas into half-baked ones, and who
turned many half-baked ones into cornerstones of this book. Most importantly,
she has helped me focus on this book and get it finished when it would have
been easy to give up on it. I promise not to take on another book project any­
time soon because Pam has suffered enough for this one.

aboutness
“Subject matter” organization involves
the use of a classification system that
provides categories and descriptive
terms for indicating what a resource is
about. Because they use aboutness
properties that are not directly per­
ceived, methods for assigning subject
classifications
are
intellectuallyintensive and in many cases require
rigorous training to be performed con­

active resources
Active resources create effects or val­
ue on their own, sometimes when they
initiate interactions with passive re­
sources. Active resources can be peo­
ple, other living resources, computa­
tional agents, active information sour­
ces, web-based services, self-driving
cars, robots, appliances, machines or
otherwise ordinary objects like light
bulbs, umbrellas, and shoes that have
been
made
“smarter.”
(From
§4.2.3.2 Active or Operant Resources.)
activities
There are four activities that occur
naturally in every organizing system;
how explicit they are depend on the
scope, the breadth or variety of the re­
sources, and the scale, the number of
resources that the organizing system
encompasses. (From §3.1 Introduc­
tion.)

that happen to go together to satisfy a
goal. The resources might not have
any discernible properties in common.
(From ad hoc.)
affordance
The concept of affordance, introduced
by J. J. Gibson, then extended and
popularized by Donald Norman, cap­
tures the idea that physical resources
and their environments have inherent
actionable properties that determine,
in conjunction with an actor’s capabili­
ties and cognition, what can be done
with the resource. (From §3.4.1 Afford­
ance and Capability.)
See also capability
agency
Agency is the extent to which a re­
source can initiate actions on its own.
We can define a continuum between
completely passive resources that can­
not initiate any actions and active re­
sources that can initiate actions based
on information they sense from their
environments or obtain through inter­
actions with other resources. (From
§4.2.3 Resource Agency.)
agent
We use the more general word, agent,
for any entity capable of autonomous
and intentional organizing effort, be­
cause it treats organizing work done
by people and organizing work done
by computers as having common
goals, despite obvious differences in
methods. (From §1.7 The Concept of
“Agent”.)
agents
A facet in the hierarchical structure of
the AAT thesaurus. Basically, people
and the various groups and organiza­
tions with which they identify, whether
based on physical, mental, socioeconomic, or political characteristics—

What is the value of this resource?
What is its cost? At what rate does it
depreciate? Does it have a shelf life?
Does it have any associated ratings,
rankings, or quality measures? More­

architectural perspective
The architectural perspective empha­
sizes the number and abstraction level
of the components of a relationship,
which together characterize its com­

arity
The degree or arity of a relationship is
the number of entity types or catego­

This is usually, though not always, the
same as the number of arguments in
the relationship expression. (From

An attribute is a syntactic component
of XML elements and a conceptual
component of the XML Infoset, con­
sisting of a potentially qualified name
and a value, whose type may influence
its interpretation. The value of an at­
tribute in an XML document is a Uni­
code string. The value of that attribute
in the XML Infoset could be a simple
string of text, a precisely-typed nu­
meric or temporal value, a list of refer­
ences to document nodes, a hypertext
link, or a reference to a formal nota­
tion. (See also element item)

property:
“is-the-author-of,”
“ismarried-to,” “is-employed-by,” etc.
(From §6.3.1 Types of Semantic Rela­
tionships (page 278).)
authentication
Is the resource what it claims to be? ( (page
202)§4.5.3 Authenticity) Resource de­
scriptions that can support authentica­
tion include technological ones like
time stamps, watermarking, encryp­
tion, checksums, and digital signa­
tures. (From §5.3.2 Determining the
Purposes (page 234).)
authenticity
In ordinary use we say that something
is authentic if it can be shown to be,
or has come to be accepted as what it
claims to be. The importance and nu­
ance of questions about authenticity
can be seen in the many words we
have to describe the relationship be­
tween “the real thing” (the “original”)
and something else: copy, reproduc­
tion, replica, fake, phony, forgery,
counterfeit, pretender, imposter, ring­
er, and so on. (From §4.5.3 Authentici­
ty.)
See also provenance
authority control
For bibliographic resources important
aspects of vocabulary control include
determining the authoritative forms
for author names, uniform titles of
works, and the set of terms by which a
particular subject will be known. In li­
brary science, the process of creating
and maintaining these standard names
and terms is known as authority con­
trol. (From §4.4.3.2 Use Controlled Vo­
cabularies.)

bi-directional links
When a bi-directional link is created
between an anchor and a destination,
it is as though a one-way link that can
be followed in the opposite direction is
automatically created. Two one-way
links serve the same purpose, but the
return link is not automatically estab­
lished when the first one is created.

bibliographic description
Bibliographic descriptions character­

A bibliography is a description re­

bibliometrics
Information scientists began studying
the structure of scientific citation, now
called bibliometrics, nearly a century
ago to identify influential scientists
and publications. (From §6.5.3.3 Bib­
liometrics, Shepardizing, Altmetrics,
and Social Network Analysis.)

For digital resources, inexpensive
storage and high bandwidth have
largely eliminated capacity as a con­
straint for organizing systems, with an

binary antonyms
Contrasting or binary antonyms are
used in mutually exclusive contexts
where one or the other word can be
used, but never both. For example,
“alive” and “dead” can never be used
at the same time to describe the state
of some entity, because the meaning of
one excludes or contradicts the mean­
ing of the other. (From §6.4.1.5 Anton­
ymy.)

A binary link connects one anchor to
one destination. (From binary links.)

A blob is any resource whose internal

character
Unicode makes the important distinc­
tion between characters and glyphs. A
character is the smallest meaningful
unit of a written language. In
alphabet-based languages like Eng­
lish, characters are letters; in lan­
guages like Chinese, characters are
ideographs. (From §9.3.1 Notations.)
character encoding
A notation that has had numbers as­
signed to its characters is called a
character encoding. (From §9.3.1 No­

The most ambitious character coding
in existence is Unicode, which as of
version 6.0 assigns numbers to
109,449 characters. Unicode makes

Chronological ordering is arranging
resources according to the date of
their creation or other important
event in the lifetime of the resource
(From §1.6 The Concept of “Organizing

classes
In object-oriented programming lan­
guages, classes are schemas that
serve as templates for the creation of
objects. A class in a programming lan­
guage is analogous to a database
schema that specifies the structure of
its member instances, in that the class
definition specifies how instances of
the class are constructed in terms of
data types and possible values. Pro­
gramming classes may also specify
whether data in a member object can
be accessed, and if so, how. (From
§7.5.2 Implementing Categories De­
fined by Properties.)

Categories defined by necessary and
sufficient properties are also called

classifications
A system of categories and its attend­
ant rules or access methods is typical­
ly called a classification scheme or
just the classifications. A system of
categories captures the distinctions

and for a particular context of use,
creating a reference model or concep­
tual roadmap for its users. (From

classifying
When we make an assertion that a
particular instance is a member of

class inclusion
Class inclusion is the fundamental and
familiar “is-a,” “is-a-type-of,” or
“subset” relationship between two en­

tained in and thus more specific than
the other more generic one. (From

clustering
clustering
Clustering techniques share the goal
of creating meaningful categories
from a collection of items whose prop­
erties are hard to directly perceive
and evaluate, which implies that cate­
gory membership cannot easily be re­
duced to specific property tests and
instead must be based on similarity.
(From §7.5.3.3 Categories Created by
Clustering (page 372).)
The end result of clustering is a stat­
istically optimal set of categories in
which the similarity of all the items
within a category is larger than the
similarity of items that belong to dif­
ferent categories.
cognates
Many words in different languages
have common roots, and as a result
are often spelled the same or nearly
the same. This is especially true for
technology words; for example, “com­
puter” has been borrowed by many
languages. The existence of these cog­
nates and borrowed words makes us
vulnerable to false cognates. When a
word in one language has a different
meaning and refers to different re­
sources in another, the results can be
embarrassing or disastrous. “Gift” is
poison in German; “pain” is bread in
French. (From §4.4.2.2 Homonymy,
Polysemy, and False Cognates.)
collection
A collection is a group of resources
that have been selected for some pur­
pose. (From §1.4 The Concept of “Col­
lection”.)
collection development
Libraries and museums usually make
their selection principles explicit in
collection development policies. Add­
ing a resource to a library collection is
called acquisition, but adding to a mu­
seum collection is called accessioning.

Documenting the contents of library
and museum collections to organize
them is called cataloging. Circulation
is a central interaction in libraries, but
because museum resources do not cir­
culate the primary interactions for
museum users are viewing or visiting
the collection. Maintenance activities
are usually described as preservation
or curation. (From §3.1 Introduction.)
collocation
The Organizing System for a small col­
lection can sometimes use only the
minimal or default organizing princi­
ple of colocation—putting all the re­
sources in the same location: in the
same container, on the same shelf, or
in the same email in-box. (From

data
content rules
Content rules are similar to controlled
vocabularies because they also limit
the possible values that can be used in
descriptions. Instead of specifying a
fixed set of values, content rules typi­
cally restrict descriptions by requiring
them to be of a particular data type
(integer, Boolean, Date, and so on).
(From §5.3.4.3 Controlled Vocabularies
and Content Rules.)
contextual properties
Contextual properties are those rela­
ted to the situation or context in which
a resource is described. Dey defines
context as “any information that char­
acterizes a situation related to the in­
teractions between users, applica­
tions, and the surrounding environ­
ment.” (From §5.3.3.4 Extrinsic Dy­
namic Properties.)
controlled vocabulary
One way to encourage good names for
a given resource domain or task is to
establish a controlled vocabulary. A
controlled vocabulary is like a fixed or
closed dictionary that includes the
terms that can be used in a particular
domain. A controlled vocabulary
shrinks the number of words used, re­
ducing synonymy and homonymy,
eliminating undesirable associations,
leaving behind a set of words with
precisely defined meanings and rules
governing
their
use.

§4.4.3.2 Use Controlled Vocabularies.)

Curation is a maintenance activity.
Curation usually refers to the methods
or systems that add value to and pre­
serve resources, while the concept of
governance more often emphasizes
the institutions or organizations that
carry out those activities. The former
is most often used for libraries, muse­
ums, or archives and the latter for en­

with, or interpreting the primary one.
Description resources are essential in
organizing systems where the primary
resources are not under its control

Hypertext expresses relationships
among resources. Hypertext is “a pro­

(See §6.5.3.1 Hypertext Links.)

identifying
Another purpose of resource descrip­
tion is to enable a user to confirm the
identity of a specific resource or to
distinguish among several that have
some overlapping descriptions. Com­
puter processable resource descrip­
tions like bar codes, QR codes, or
RFID tags are also used to identify re­
sources. In Semantic Web contexts,
URIs serve this purpose. (From

implicit classification
§6.2 Describing Relationships: An Over­
view (page 275).)
implicit classification
Because names and dates can take on
a great many values, an organizing
principle like alphabetical or chrono­
logical ordering is unlikely to enumer­
ate in advance an explicit category for
each possible value. Instead, we can
consider these organizing principles
as creating an implicit or latent classi­
fication system in which the catego­
ries are generated only as needed. For
example, the Q category only exists in
an alphabetical scheme if there is a re­
source whose name starts with Q.
(From §8.1.4 Classification Schemes.)
imposed policies
Imposed Policies are mandated by an
external entity and the organizing sys­
tem must comply with them. (From
§3.4.3 Access Policies.)
inclusion relationship
One entity type contains or is com­
prised of other entity types; often ex­
pressed using “is-a,” “is-a-type-of,” “ispart-of,” or “is-in” predicates. (From
§6.3.1 Types of Semantic Relationships

searched efficiently. (From §1.4 The
Concept of “Collection”.)
individual categorization
Individual categories are created in an
organizing system to satisfy the ad

Glossary

hoc requirements that arise from a
person’s unique experiences, prefer­
ences, and resource collections. Un­
like cultural categories, which usually
develop slowly and last a long time, in­
dividual categories are created by in­
tentional activity, in response to a spe­
cific situation, or to solve an emerging
organizational
challenge.
(From
§7.2.2 Individual Categories.)
inflectional morphology
Inflectional mechanisms change the
form of a word to represent tense, as­
pect, agreement, or other grammatical
information. Unlike derivation, inflec­
tion never changes the part-of-speech
of the base morpheme. The inflection­
al morphology of English is relatively
simple compared with other languag­
es. (From §6.4.3.2 Inflectional Morphol­
ogy.)
informatics
Informatics is a broad academic cate­
gory encompassing the science of in­
formation, including the automation of
information processing. Computer sci­
ence, information architecture and
web architecture are among the rela­
ted academic disciplines.
information architecture
Abstract patterns of information con­
tent or organization are sometimes
called architectures, so it is straight­
forward from the perspective of the
discipline of organizing to define the
activity of information architecture as
designing an abstract and effective or­
ganization of information and then ex­
posing that organization to facilitate
navigation and information use. (From
§3.3.3.2 “Information Architecture” and
Organizing Systems.)
information component
An information component can be: (1)
Any piece of information that has a
unique label or identifier or (2) Any

intentional arrangement
piece of information that is selfcontained and comprehensible on its
own. (From §4.3.3 Identity and Infor­
mation Components.)
information organization
Traditional information organization
activities include bibliographic de­
scription and cataloging.
information retrieval
Traditional information retrieval activ­
ities include automated text process­
ing, indexing and search.
instance
See resource.
institutional categorization
In contrast to cultural categories that
are created and used implicitly, and to
individual categories that are used by
people acting alone, institutional cate­
gories are created and used explicitly,
and most often by many people in co­
ordination with each other. Institution­
al categories are most often created in
abstract and information-intensive do­
mains where unambiguous and pre­
cise categories are needed to regulate
and systematize activity, to enable in­
formation sharing and reuse, and to
reduce
transaction
costs.
(From
§7.2.3 Institutional Categories.)
institutional semantics
Systems of institutional semantics of­
fer precisely defined abstractions or
information components ( (page 185)
§4.3.3 Identity and Information Com­
ponents) needed to ensure that infor­
mation can be efficiently exchanged
and used. (From §8.1.5.2 Institutional
Semantics.)
institutional taxonomies
Institutional taxonomies are classifica­
tions designed to make it more likely
that people or computational agents
will organize and interact with resour­

ces in the same way. (From §8.1.5.1 In­
stitutional Taxonomies.)
integration
Integration is the controlled sharing of
information between two (or more)
business systems, applications, or
services within or between firms. Inte­
gration means that one party can ex­
tract or obtain information from an­
other one, it does not imply that the
recipient can make use of the informa­
tion. (From §6.8.3 Integration and In­
teroperability.)
integrity of classification
Changes in the meaning of the catego­
ries in a classification threaten its in­
tegrity, the principle that categories
should not move within the structure
of the classification system. (From
§8.2.2.3 Principles for Maintaining the
Classification over Time.)
intension
Categories whose members are deter­
mined by one or more properties or
rules follow the principle of intension­
al definition, and the defining proper­
ties are called the intension. (From
§7.3.2 Single Properties.)
intensional definition
Categories whose members are deter­
mined by one or more properties or
rules follow the principle of intension­

intentional arrangement
Intentional arrangement emphasizes
explicit or implicit acts of organization
by people, or by computational pro­
cesses acting as proxies for, or as im­
plementations of, human intentionali­
ty. (From §1.5 The Concept of “Inten­

interaction
interaction
An interaction is an action, function,
service, or capability that makes use
of the resources in a collection or the
collection as a whole. The interaction
of access is fundamental in any collec­
tion of resources, but many Organiz­
ing Systems provide additional func­
tions to make access more efficient
and to support additional interactions
with the accessed resources. (From
§1.8 The Concept of “Interactions”.)
interoperability
Interoperability goes beyond integra­
tion to mean that systems, applica­
tions, or services that exchange infor­
mation can make sense of what they
receive. Interoperability can involve
identifying corresponding components
and relationships in each system,
transforming them syntactically to the
same format, structurally to the same
granularity, and semantically to the
same meaning. (From §6.8.3 Integra­
tion and Interoperability.)
inverse document frequency
Inverse document frequency (idf) is a
collection-level property. The docu­
ment frequency (df) is the number of
resources containing a particular
term. The inverse document frequency
(idf) for a term is defined as idft =
log(N/dft), where N is the total num­
ber of documents. The inverse docu­
ment frequency of a term decreases
the more documents contain the term,
providing a discriminating factor for
the importance of terms in a query.
(From §10.4.2.1 Ranked Retrieval with
Vector Space or Probabilistic Models.)
inverse relationship
For asymmetric relationships, it is of­
ten useful to be explicit about the
meaning of the relationship when the
order of the arguments in the relation­
ship is reversed. The resulting rela­

locative inclusion
Locative inclusion is a type of inclu­
sion relationship between an area and
what it surrounds or contains. It is
most often expressed using “is-in” as
the relationship. However, the entity
that is contained or surrounded is not
a part of the including one, so this is
not a part-whole relationship.

volves learning because over time the
classifier improves its performance by
adjusting the weights for features that
distinguish the categories. But strictly
speaking, supervised learning techni­
ques do not learn the categories; they
implement and apply categories that
they inherit or are given to them.

preservation
Preservation is a maintenance activi­

preservation metadata
Preservation metadata is technical
information about resource formats
and technology needed to ensure re­
source and collection integrity in a
maintenance
context.
(From
§5.3.2.4 Resource Description to Sup­
port Maintenance (page 238).)
primary resource
Treating as a primary resource any­
thing that can be identified is an im­
portant generalization of the concept
because it enables web-based serv­
ices, data feeds, objects with RFID
tags, sensors or other smart devices,
or computational agents to be part of
Organizing Systems. (From §1.3 The
Concept of “Resource”.)
property
In this book we use property in a ge­
neric and ordinary sense as a synonym
for feature or “characteristic.” Many
cognitive and computer scientists are
more precise in defining these terms
and reserve property for binary predi­
cates (e.g., something is red or not,
round or not). If multiple values are
possible, the property is called an at­
tribute, “dimension,” or “variable.”
(From §3.3 Organizing Resources.)
property-based categorization
Property-based categorization works
tautologically well for categories like
“prime number” where the category is
defined by necessary and sufficient
properties. Property-based categoriza­
tion also works well when properties
are conceptually distinct and the value
of a property is easy to perceive and
examine, as they are with man-made
physical resources like shirts. (From
§7.3.4 The Limits of Property-Based
Categorization.)

quality
A quality is an attribute or property
of a resource. A quality is logically as­
cribable by a subject. (Ed.)
Quality is a measure of the fitness of
purpose of a resource or service. It is
the difference between what was plan­
ned or expected versus what was real­
ized or manifest; it is as an assess­
ment of the suitability of a resource or
interaction. (Ed.)

natural language is typically a precur­

A principle of good descriptions: Use
descriptions that reflect how the re­
sources describe themselves; assume
that self-descriptions are accurate.
(From §5.3.4.1 Principles of Good De­
scription (page 247).)
resolution
For a digital resource, its identifier
serves as the input to the system or
function that determines its location
so it can be retrieved, a process called
resolving the identifier or resolution.
(From §4.1.2 Identity, Identifiers, and
Names.)
resource
Resource has an ordinary sense of
anything of value that can support
goal-oriented activity. This definition

means that a resource can be a physi­
cal thing, a non-physical thing, infor­
mation about physical things, informa­
tion about non-physical things, or any­
thing you want to organize. Other
words that aim for this broad scope
are entity, object, item, and instance.
Document is often used for an infor­
mation resource in either digital or
physical format; artifact refers to re­
sources created by people, and asset
for resources with economic value.
Resource has specialized meaning in
Internet architecture. It is convention­
al to describe web pages, images, vid­
eos, and so on as resources, and the
protocol for accessing them, Hyper­
text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), uses
the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
(From §1.3 The Concept of “Re­
source”.)
resource description
We describe resources so that we can
refer to them, distinguish among
them, search for them, manage access
to them, preserve them, and make
predictions about what might happen
to them or what they might do. Each
purpose may require different re­
source descriptions. We use resource
descriptions in every communication
and conversation; they are the ena­
blers of organizing systems.
Resource Description Framework (RDF)
The Resource Description Frame­
work (RDF) metamodel is a directed
graph, so it identifies one node (the
one from which the edge is pointing)
as the subject of the triple, and the
other node (the one to which the edge
is pointing) as its object. The edge is
referred to as the predicate of the tri­
ple. (From §9.2.2.3 RDF (page 453).)

selecting
Determining the scope of the organiz­

Selecting in this context means the
user activity of using resource de­

Self-organizing systems can change
their internal structure or their func­

semantic balance
Top-level facets should be the proper­
ties that best differentiate the resour­
ces in the classification domain. The
values should be of equal semantic
scope so that resources are distrib­
uted among the subcategories. Subfa­
cets of “Cookware” like “Sauciers and
Saucepans” and “Roasters and Brasi­
ers” are semantically balanced as they
are both named and grouped by cook­
ing activity. (From §8.4.4.2 Design
Principles and Pragmatics (page 425).)

The semantic gap is the difference in
perspective in naming and description
when resources are described by auto­

semantic web
The vision of a Semantic Web world
builds upon the web world, but adds
some further prescriptions and con­
straints for how to structure descrip­
tions. The Semantic Web world unifies
the concept of a resource as it has
been developed in this book, with the
web notion of a resource as anything
with a URI. On the Semantic Web,
anything being described must have a
URI. Furthermore, the descriptions
must be structured as graphs, adher­
ing to the RDF metamodel and relat­
ing resources to one another via their
URIs. Advocates of Linked Data fur­
ther prescribe that those descriptions
must be made available as representa­
tions transferred over HTTP. (From
§9.4.3 The Semantic Web World.)
sensemaking
Sensemaking (or sense-making) is the

stopword elimination
Stopwords are those words in a lan­

are not very semantically expressive.
Stopwords are usually articles, pro­
nouns, prepositions, or conjunctions.
Since they occur in every text, they
can be removed because they cannot
distinguish them. Of course, in some
cases, removing stopwords might re­
move semantically important phrases
(e.g., “To be or not to be”). (From

stuff is not a separate ingredient that
is used to make the object; it is a con­
stituent of it once it is made. (From

Symmetric relationships are bidirectional; they express the same re­

as they do from the object to the sub­

subject
In the RDF metamodel, a pair of nodes
and its edge is called a triple, because
it consists of three parts (two nodes
and one edge). The RDF metamodel is
a directed graph, so it identifies one
node (the one from which the edge is
pointing) as the subject of the triple,
and the other node (the one to which
the edge is pointing) as its object. The
edge is referred to as the predicate or
(as we have been saying) property of
the triple. (From §9.2.2.3 RDF.)

formation to serve their purposes and

syntax
The syntax and grammar of a lan­
guage consists of the rules that deter­

nouns, verbs, adjectives and other
parts of speech, but they differ greatly

theory-based category
A final psychological principle for cre­

tokenization
Segments the stream of characters (in
an encoding scheme, a space is also a
character) into textual components,
usually words. In English, a simple
rule-based system can separate words
using spaces. However, punctuation
makes things more complicated. For
example, periods at the end of senten­
ces should be removed, but periods in
numbers should not. Other languages
introduce other problems for tokeniza­
tion; in Chinese, a space does not
mark the divisions between individual
concepts. (From the sidebar Text Pro­

topological inclusion
Topological inclusion is a type of in­
clusion relationship between a con­

“is-in” as the relationship. However,

transclusion
The inclusion, by hypertext reference,
of a resource or part of a resource into
another resource is called transclu­
sion. Transclusion is normally per­
formed automatically, without user in­
tervention. The inclusion of images in
web documents is an example of
transclusion. Transclusion is a fre­
quently used technique in business
and legal document processing, where
re-use of consistent and up-to-date
content is essential to achieve efficien­
cy and consistency. (From §6.5.3.1 Hy­

transformation
Transformation is a very broad con­
cept but in the context of organizing
systems it typically means a change in
a resource representation or descrip­
tion. The transformation can involve
the selection, restructuring, or rear­
rangement of resources or parts of
them. (See §10.3.2 Transforming Re­
sources for Interactions (page 500).)
transitivity
Transitivity is another property that
can apply to semantic relationships.
When a relationship is transitive, if X
and Y have a relationship, and Y and Z
have the same relationship, then X al­
so has the relationship with Z. Any re­
lationship based on ordering is transi­
tive, which includes numerical, alpha­
betic, and chronological ones as well
as those that imply qualitative or
quantitative
measurement.
(From
§6.3.2.2 Transitivity.)
tree
Trees consist of nodes joined by
edges, recursively nested. When a sin­

triple
tionaries, we say that the dictionaries
are nested into a kind of tree struc­
ture.
A tree is a constrained graph. Trees
are directed graphs because the “pa­
rent of” relationship between nodes is
asymmetric: the edges are arrows that
point in a certain direction. Trees are
acyclic graphs, because if you follow
the directed edges from one node to
another, you can never encounter the
same node twice. Finally, trees have
the constraint that every node (except
the root) must have exactly one pa­
rent. (From §9.2.1.5 Trees (page 445).)
triple
In the RDF metamodel, a pair of nodes
and its edge is called a triple, because
it consists of three parts (two nodes
and one edge). The RDF metamodel is
a directed graph, so it identifies one
node (the one from which the edge is
pointing) as the subject of the triple,
and the other node (the one to which
the edge is pointing) as its object. The
edge is referred to as the predicate or
(as we have been saying) property of
the triple. (From §9.2.2.3 RDF.)

user convenience
Choose description terms with the
user in mind; these are likely to be
terms in common usage among the
target audience. (From §5.3.4.1 Princi­
ples of Good Description (page 247).)
user warrant
The principle of scientific warrant ar­
gues that only the categories recog­
nized by the scientists or experts in a
domain should be used in a classifica­
tion system, and it is often opposed by
the principle of use or user warrant,
which chooses categories and descrip­
tive terms according to their frequen­
cy of use by everyone, not just ex­
perts. (From §8.2.2.1 Principles Em­
bodied in the Classification Scheme.)

value
We distinguish between the type of
the attribute and the value that it has.
For example, the color of any object is
an attribute of the object, and the val­
ue of that attribute might be “green.”

validation
Validation is the process of verifying
that a document or data structure con­
forms with its schema or schemas.
Markup validation confirms the struc­
ture of the document. Type validation
confirms that the content of leaf nodes
conforms with the specification of data
types. Content validation confirms
that the values of the leaf nodes are
appropriate. Link validation confirms
the integrity of the links between no­
des and between documents. Cross
validation is the method commonly
used for model selection. Business
rule validation confirms compliance
with business rules. (Discussed in

fined by Properties (page 361),

vocabulary problem
Every natural language offers more
than one way to express any thought,
and in particular there are usually
many words that can be used to refer
to the same thing or concept. (From

guages in this way. Many of the writ­
ing systems used for describing re­
sources belong to this latter group,
meaning that (at least in principle)
they can be used with equal facility by
speakers of any language. (From
§9.3.2 Writing Systems.)

warrant principle
The warrant principle concerns the
justification for the choice of catego­
ries and the names given to them.
(From §8.2.2.1 Principles Embodied in
the Classification Scheme.)

Some writing systems, such as XML
and JSON, are closely identified with
specific metamodels.

work
An abstract idea of an author’s intel­
lectual or artistic creation.

XInclude
XML Inclusions (XInclude)

The distinctions put forth by Panizzi,
Lubetzky, Svenonius and other library
science theorists have evolved today
into a four-step abstraction hierarchy
(see Figure 4.5, The FRBR Abstraction
Hierarchy.) between the abstract
work, an expression in multiple for­
mats or genres, a particular manifes­
tation in one of those formats or gen­
res, and a specific physical item.
writing system
A writing system employs one or more
notations, and adds a set of rules for
using them. Most writing systems as­
sume knowledge of a particular hu­
man language. These writing systems
are known as glottic writing systems.
But there are many writing systems,
such as mathematical and musical
ones, that are not tied to human lan­

well-formed
The syntax and grammar of a lan­
guage consists of the rules that deter­
mine which combinations of its words
are allowed and are thus grammatical
or well-formed. Natural languages
have substantial similarities by having
nouns, verbs, adjectives and other
parts of speech, but they differ greatly
in how they arrange them to create
sentences. (From §6.7.2 Syntax and
Grammar.)

XML Information Set
The XML Infoset is a tree structure,
where each node of the tree is defined
to be an “information item” of a par­
ticular type. Each information item
has a set of type-specific properties
associated with it. At the root of the
tree is a “document item,” which has
exactly one “element item” as its
child. An element item has a set of at­
tribute items, and a list of child nodes.
These child nodes may include other
element items, or they may be charac­
ter items. (See (page 442)§9.2.1 Kinds
of Structures below for more on char­

zoo
acters.) Attribute items may contain
character items, or they may contain
typed data, such as name tokens, iden­
tifiers and references. Element identi­
fiers and references (ID/IDREF) may
be used to connect nodes, transform­
ing a tree into a graph. (From
§9.2.2.2.)

XML documents into other documents.
For example, XSLT can be used to con­
vert XML data into HTML documents
for web display or PDF for print or
screen display. XSLT processing en­
tails taking an input document in XML
format and one or more XSLT style
sheets through a template-processing
engine to produce a new document.

Note
In this PDF-format hypertext ebook, the index is an organizing sys­
tem that presents an alphabetical arrangement of terms to enable
look-up and discovery of corresponding subject matter, selectable
with page references that lead the reader to a term’s first use, its
definition or a featured mention within the content. Where a page
number repeats, it indicates a distinct and noteworthy entry on that
page; we have indexed down to the paragraph, footnote, and even
phrase level. Our intent is for this Index to be a useful discovery in­
terface. If the PDF reader interface frustrates our humble efforts, we
apologize for your discomfort.—MM

Colophon
The authors created textual content using various ver­
sions of Microsoft Word. The editors managed, organ­
ized and massaged the content in Word files using the
DropBox cloud. Those Word documents were then sent
out for transformation into DocBook representations
using scripts and hand editing. Then the DocBook files
were encoded with extensive semantic tagging and hy­
pertext relationships, including bibliographic and index
references, and transclusion of content from the chap­
ters into the quizzes and glossary. The editors used vi,
oXygen XML Editor, XML Spy and XMetaL word pro­
cessors on OS X and Windows platforms.
The content of the printed book, as well as the third
and fourth edition PDF, is presented using OpenType
DejaVu fonts. The text font is DejaVuSerif; the heading
font is DejaVuSans. The monospaced font used for code
samples and literal text is DejaVuMono. The condensed
font used in the index is DejaVuSerifCondensed; some
labels use DejaVuSansCondensed. A small number of
characters require a Unicode font to represent them;
the Unicode font used for print and PDF versions of this
book is Adobe Song Standard. Emphasis is presented in
bold, italic, or oblique variants of the corresponding
font families.

Progressive inten­
tional

ples.
The cover is An

Knockout.

The PDF manifestation of the third and fourth editions
of The Discipline of Organizing were built in oXygen using customized XSLT
scripts to profile and transform the DocBook5 files into XHTML5 files, which are
then processed using CSS and the Antenna House Formatter V6 to produce an
accessible paginated Portable Document Format document. The first printed ed­
ition of The Discipline of Organizing was built with Altas from O’Reilly Media.
The ePub3 electronic book editions offered by O'Reilly Media are built from the
DocBook 5 sources using customized XSLT scripts created by Bob Stayton,
Sagehill Enterprises and maintained by Jirka Kosek. The scripts take advantage
of discipline and user-level values encoded in DocBook attributes to produce
profiled, static ePub 3 editions.
